Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself


I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga


Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit


The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake] ×9
Could it be the way that I'll catch up(Johnny Juliano)
(Cardo got wings)
Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there, talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing


Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors when you can’t do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How a nigga s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Dre told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, "Why a nigga can’t live?"
Get this money, fuck these bitches though
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
"We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical"
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my Four Pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas, be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit,40, I'm fucked up

[Hook: Drake +]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred
, yeah, one hundred
, all I ever asked is one hundred
, yeah, one hundred
All I ever asked is one hundred


Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself...

[Hook: Drake +]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred
, yeah, one hundred
, all I ever asked is one hundred
, yeah, one hundred
All I ever asked is one hundred


Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, "Here it go"
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'm a always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

[Hook: Drake +]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred
, yeah, one hundred
, all I ever asked is one hundred
, yeah, one hundred
All I ever asked is one hundredI can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"


10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace


I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now


I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone till November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been


Momma’ was a trick
Daddy was a treat
Yellin’ and fighting hard
He didn’t care about me

But you won’t see me cry
No, you won’t see me snitch
Ain’t no time for the drama
Cuz’ I already  rich
Muda fuckas said she wants a bitch
She fucked me
Dropped me
Just to stop
Ain't going to stop
[Nigga from the 15th century

TAnd I’ll remember your face
But I’m not coming home
‘Cause I’m stuck in this place
Where it pays big to roam
Break stage right, missed that flight
Now it’s airport naps, short break, next port
Who are you? Just ask the mirror
Stake it out and fake ‘em out, next city break it out
Time for rest, did your best
Now you move it, groove it, fast, prove it
She cries out, listen, hear her
Celebrate, initiate, live once, appreciate
Its
Uh uh uh fuckup

But i fucked

Fifteen century is fuck

Fifteenth century magic  so clear
I'm just so fancy

Who else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G though
Treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows
I'm trying to tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
I live fast die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go
And tell me today's weather
I know they say they good, but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really it's whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then
And keep sleeping while Isell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking
These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry
But I ain't playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Baby girl on that Mclaren
You gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
I do it better than the best could
You know what it is, Drake and Tim WestwoodYou're from Timmins and I'm from Toronto
You worked at McDonald's and I eat McDonald's
We should be together, I think we should be together
All these other girls they're totally crazy, oh, oh, oh
Only you can make me feel the way I feel
Damn, I'm dying to make you feel like a woman, babyLet's get it, I can't wait to trick man
It's gonna be so sweet
Summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine


Still like, "Can you hit it with your OVO goose on?"
I'm like, "What are you on?"
Told me that she two on, ha, that's cute we a few on
I could show you what to do in this bitch
Take the addy with the water pop two and then sip
Me, you and your bitch
And we talkin' bout life, love too and this dick
First I had her in the six, then we had her in the six
You know I got another bar for ya
I'mma chill baby, we don't want the devil in this bitch, nah
Got a bad one we could call it Kelly Rowland
Oh she get the jelly rollin',Akinyele in the telly
Cause she open I could tell that she from Oakland
Pasadena, what up?


I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2


A nigga got a woosah, comin' at me never work no matter who try
I got 'em all a cheque without the woo-hah
Flip modes on ya quick got a few sides
Comin' from the 6 side
Where niggas goin' shower posse just to get by
Stay true never switch sides, yea, the game turn me into this guy
Yea, and now every time Drake out
Cameras always flashing tryna put me on the Takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A. the shit is way out
But these days that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB that my brother like a Wayans

You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so bad girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper
Even though you're exhausted you're still gonna make it girl
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so, you're so
You love to get 2 on


Drop down, drop-drop (Shit is real out here)
Drop down, drop-drop
Drop down, drop-drop, get it, get it
Drop down, drop-drop


Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it


They don't work hard as you, damn that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count, numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money, girl you just did it
I get it I get it, man fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit
12 months on the lease, that's a come up baby don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy, every real nigga they fuck with you
Nails chipped out in diamonds, you sparkle but fuck man, the spark ain't enough for you


Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it


Tonight was your night, go get you some lobsters and shrimp
You smart and you know it, I get it I get it, you outdo these pimps
I hope you don't fall, that's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it you did it
Got a link on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending
Your parents saying this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit
I get it I get it, I'm working too hard let's get into some fun shit
281 to my city, heard you had trouble at customs
Your girl got a DUI, I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, "Girl get your paperwork right"
I get it I get it, what's up for the night?


Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it


Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives , got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they care to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I
Was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off with Ain't I
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena
But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they knowTake yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground


Yeah, all hail Mr. Lyrical
Spades or the Opus, baby, what you got a feeling for?
I can show you new things,have you feeling spiritual
Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes - miwacles
Yeah, ok, they say that I'm the one, in fact
Some say that I'm theirfavourite
But I ain't hearing none of that
I’m about my team, ho, Young Moneyrunning back
Cash Money superstar,where the fuck is Stunna at?
Damn


Untouchable40 with my AK
Mastermind, big money heavy weight
On the grind,flipping money in every way
Headline, my bitch shine everyday
Pearl white Don P,Marc Jacobs gloves
Cartier Louiscase with a dope plod
From the mud where they what you leave in your blood
Going in, flipping hundreds get the young plug
Show ‘em where it go
Floating on the floor, getting more dough
Grind hard, go, black diamond show, watch the flame blow
And how you stay grounded? Cash no go
And how you stay mounded? Cash no flow
And how you stay shining? Bentley off the floor
And how you stay high? Purple pine dro
Diamond minks, fur, February snow




Uhh, you know you paid when you got Baby with ya
It's Young Money like Ben Frank's baby pictures
I’m a lady twisterI kiss her whiskers
I been running this shit - blisters
Sticking to the script: movie star money
And if you gassed up, I leave the car running
I’m a big smoker, I’m a little drinker
My peace sign is just the trigger and the middle finger
Wha-what you know about it, man ya’llclueless
I let two women ride me, that's car-poolers
I rock stupid ice, Mr. Water Coolers
If y'all in the building then we are intruders
Simmer down pimpin', let me handle this
I know the game - analyst
Man I’m the shit, And y'all janitors
Blow out the kush and crack a smile for the camerasYeah
This on some "old Tommy Campos Dice Raw” shit
For my niggas, though


You underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
You probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just being frank with you
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with you?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake
Str8, Y pree?Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like there's wire taps on the team
Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real
Some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga who's time is comin'
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music
I swear, fuck them niggas this year
I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list,everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eating like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same,this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill
Boy we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will
All them boys is my wheels
Anything happen to pop then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refuse to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for ten
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryin' to win here again
Man, what's up?


Yeah
A young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty
Aww yeahI'll admit it, I'll admit it
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy, get hurt, boy
Aww, here go another mo'fucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy
Shit hot up in the 6 right now, shit hot up in the 6, boy
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now
Come see us and get it fixed, boy
Black Benz on the road, boy, already had a Rolls Royce
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys
I give a fuck about old boy
I give a fuck about his squad, boy
I give a fuck about your mob, boy
I'm the real 6 God, boy
I'm about to say a true thing
I'm about to say a true thing
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
God damn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right nowBoomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm... (Louuuu)
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift


Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with nigga's souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Louuuu)


Work the night shift
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift


If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got meYeah, yeah, oh, you gotta love it
Oh, you got, oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual, my career's like a "how to "manual
So I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love itOctobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF
Thank me later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup
June 15th in this bitch wasup
Noel That’s it AhhhhhhChances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her


It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game


Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more




When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game


It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game







(Check, check, check. 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.)

Diamonds hang around my neck; the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year is all business

It is a shame that a couple of them are off limits. No offense to my nigga
It’s just the industry small, we all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it

I know he ain’t trippin’
I know I got a couple things that Lil Wayne dipped in
Ain’t ashamed to admit it: I be the same with it

This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you fuck and the ones you wife up
Just don’t let them fuck your life up
Half a mil' to perform, I can’t let em fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it’s lit up

Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple Warhols for my hallways

New verses crush the hood like I’m driving into somethin'
Bitches on the kid like I’m Iverson or somethin
Like a Sixer since I sold six eighty in my first

Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curseDiamonds hang around my neck,the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year it’s all business

Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse
Swag!Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real


Money on my mind, you should think the same,J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork,watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto,we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing,Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested(Truu)




I touched down in '86,knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit,and my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next
But I’m about as big as it gets, I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn ‘cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I’m on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales,I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances, then I just got paid like eight advances
God damn!



Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental,I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't doand still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple, I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything -- everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit,good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine,leave you split, in the half,smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it,niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...


Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back?(no more free Randy)
I’m blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous, clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
‘Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talking through the window like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man, now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I doIt's rap oldest rookie and it's youngest veteran
Go get us Sprite its for the drink, back together bitch
Mr. Doin' It doin' it, what could be better bitch
The dynamic duo, a two man dream team
My pockets stay swollen, call me Mr. Cream Jean
Rocking white diamonds, that vanilla cream bling
They got the game locked down, call it sing sing
You cats straight down in Houston, me proper dos
In a corner booth chilling with some proper hoes
I hit Toronto girls, hold me for ransom
Til I let 'em buy me Polo or they throw me ransom
Damn son, it's like the best of both worlds
That's your wifey and your side, ya getting the best of both girls
So I'mma go ahead and leave the clock running
I ain't finna stop going, you ain't finna stop coming
When the head boy banging, it's like the Funky Drummer drumming
I go right to left and left to right, back to forth, it's nothing
This is something for the gangstas, something for the riders
With a pistol and the money and boppa right beside us
We highly flammable, you better not ignite us
You suffering from put one in the pussy nigga ride us
Goddamn we killing it, ya kids gon' have to hide us
So if you ain't coming with us then you gon' have to write us
Cause it's on



All of the lights, lights, all of the lights


Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights


Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there
I’m on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university


(All of the lights) Cop lights, flash lights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)




Restraining order, can’t see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I’ll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby please
Can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university



Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own


Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
K, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time (We going all the way this time)


We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time (We going all the way this time)

Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell,I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this "give or take" world I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time,you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'mma let it shine

"Westside bitch," quote, unquote
Woah there boy, don't go there ho
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named "Big" got bodied?
But every rapper named "Sean" got money?
Well I guess my chances are 50/50
But my vision is 20/20 so I be counting a hundred 100's
Oh my Allah,Lordy lordy lordy,I took your chick
Now you want beef and I am chuckling like I'm Porky
Cause you spend all day with her spooning
I spend all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and
They want these bullets to book it for me
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gonna book report me
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard, because bitch I'm an emergency





Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding
Weezy with me, I just stepped out of the strip club
Made 5000 look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made $2 million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I don't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your own girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with ME when she tells you she needs some "me time"
It's our time, so fuck y'all!
I'm really about to go Spring Break now start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl

Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV it won't be long 'til they can see the lights

And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga,I'm not one
So call it a night, call it a night

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!


Girl, I've been thinking about the way, that you love me every day
And I want to know, if You Feel The Same Way!!
Because I'm in and out of town, that's just how I got's to get down
But you understand, that's why I'm your man!!


I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!


I can make them easily admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game.Ahh


I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't explain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!


Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby
I need to feel you next to me, You want to feel me next to you
We can do anything you want to do
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!!!


I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh?Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap,anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck


It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM


Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country ya'll
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, an back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life,dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drinkand trips to Kroger'sjust to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!

I just wanna thank God
For all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
For my family
And lettin' me ball on these niggas


Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church(Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
Do Liv on Sunday like a church (Preach)


Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it?And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation,when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty rackson magnum bottles,I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go




Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becoming the one that made it
Yes lord!All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life putting on, you spend your whole life putting up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'mma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for




Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck)And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her)She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off)And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto cause it's a lot of...

Yeah, its drizzy baby
Ah Ha uhh I’m ready, alright J fresh I got 'em

Look, I’m really the heir to the fortune of a millionaire
Talking money with me is really unfair
At the border like, "I swear, I have nothing to declare
I am nothing like these other niggas coming out this year"
Even if you never met me you can tell I’m on the same shit
Loyal as a mother fucker nobody be saying shit
Dope boys know me cause I often speak they language
So well spoken man I should have went to Cambridge
Y-o-u-n-g ho, women they can be so
Motivated by money that’s why they be on me for
Ask your favorite rapper homie guarantee that he know
If he is the one I’m the zero, (pshh damn)
Please comprehend I am a Surf Club general
I’m Mr. consistent I have never come in intervals
You don’t want be caught in the middle like a center fold
I'm committing suicide if we're ever identical
Click clack pow how you like a nigga now?
In control of my domain
They can do what I allow
And I know Toronto miss me I'mma be home in a minute
That's my city and I run it you just run around in it
They see me out in person and say I ain't heard you sing yet
The world is my playground dont fuck with my swingset
We get the pitching then that's when it gets to piling
I'm calling your bluff don’t act like you can’t see me dialing
I'm in, low cut Louis with them hard denim jeans an a beige jacket
Hands down the best in my age bracket
Holla at meSpending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there


Come right here, set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do
No you hate explainin how you want it done
Just be quiet I'll do fine without your help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it


I been waitin for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So baby I'm a lock my door and disconnect my phone
Cause I wanna make one thing clear
I want you on top, so let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl I'm gonna turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what we're about to do




J.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in "Jodeci Freestyle".I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused.Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted.This was a learning lesson for both of us,and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try toright this wrong.J. Cole and I believe that it is the right, responsible, and respectful decision to remove the lyric from the song.Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When I'm the only one that's really spitting
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really gripping
Why you dap me up acting like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?

Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop


Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the timbs,here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day


I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon,dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around,to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova,and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X,I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, "I expected this"
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protege, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boyIswear to you Lord
Same dudes used to laugh at me
See me in the CL 6 with Haffa B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Half could blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mould you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream, but dog
Me and success are two things you don't wanna find your ass between
*Back against the wall like a plasma screens*
The inside of my wallet is pasture/ past your green
And you are now hanging withthe asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and e'ry night is New Year's
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin'
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel the Flying +Spur+ +Tony park+ it
And it's cool if you spill suttin it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior colour only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin' today
And you ain't making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move,sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm giving away
You feel me?Riding to the music, this is how we do it all night, all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss,no worries at all
Listening to theAston Martin Music


Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing


When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch one that live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottomswhole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl that swallows what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my 2-seater she's the one that I would take




Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC,VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100




Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -


I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had hislinen suitdry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah,you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

Aston Martin Music, Music
Aston Martin Music, MusicAre you familiar with this feeling
No concealing
Its out all out in the open
The type of life you first timers could soak in
That virgin pussy's waiting
And Im about to poke it
Im underrated,I am Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But im about to sleep em, Acquire em', and keep em'
I require a retainer to retire them and sweep em' in a Dust pan
New guy, Too fly, who buy seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die heaven's our's
And you don't see the jag drop in here
Its like im chasing my dad the way I tag pops in in here
Lets see how many carrots we can do
Mixin' farm land green with that paratrooper blue
Who are you? You confused homie, that's a pensive look there
Where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear
Thats a 07 but I got a even newer ride
Doors all suicide
I should be your tour guide
Im expedia flown
Wikepidia known
Obtain a key to your home
And take a seat on your throne
I been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
You are not me man I could never be you at all
Cause you just stupid dog
The A8 super large
And yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged

Aight check, flow switch, Flow switch

I don't ever pay a percentage of the retail
Only thing Im paying is attention to the detail
Schedule can change at the mention of a email
Booking up a show with some tension with a female
My Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep
Cause Drake these some big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later quarter million off of TV
You was having hoop dreams
I was drafting group schemes
Take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams
Well woop there it is
Oops now my troops clean
First car Audi drop, Color like a poutine
Im feelin grown up, Don't ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Cause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france
Inside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out
And you drive cars that I been riding out
Correction I been rode em out
Been showin' out, sold off shit the stories you've been told about
And dog, I been old amount
Young money old accounts
Degrassi my royalties
Homie you just owed an once
No weight move
My shoulder counts
Man, I don't even know my name anymore man (laughs)She be jumping up and down
Trynna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour
Just to get that belt to fasten
All she wanna talk about is partying and fashion
Don't know where she going
But I do not plan on asking at all
Cause her spirit is free
And she, lets nobody else in except for me
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree
I’m the only one she loves
There’s no copies of the key
Homie, that’s a guarantee


Don’t forget that Fendi purse that you put all your cash in
Kinda hard to concentrate when cameras are flashin’
Other dudes would suffocate her, I don’t want her gaspin’
Don’t know where she’s going
And I do not plan on asking at all
I’ve never been the type, felt alike
My connection with niggas that wanna fight
Over women, that's not right
There's too many in the world
Homie, you can have your pick
But I swear that ones my girl
I swear that one’s my girl!Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley
You can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa, very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad cause I got the midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah, goin' back to back
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah, I'm goin' back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you sayin', "Drizzy, tell 'em again"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you’d do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga
(Six)Intro :
Oh man, oh man,oh man, pas encore

Couplet :
Ouais j’ai apprit le game avec William Weskey, tu ne pourras jamais me battre
Je  reviens pour les niggas qui n'ont pas reçu le message
Je reviens comme l'Arme Fatale
Je reviens comme Jordan en 96 et 97
Woah, je très important et très prétentieux
Avec du recul je risquerais de m'en vouloir pour t'avoir donner cette attention
Mais ça pesait lourd sur ma conscience
Et puis merde, tu ne m’as pas laissé d’options
Je veux voir mes négros devenir fou
Tu vas me faire sortir de ma putain de routine
Tu vas me faire acheter des bouteilles pour Charlemagne
Tu vas me faire sortir de mon putain de chemin
J’ai attendu 4 jours négros, où tu es ?
J’ai roulé ici dans ma Rolls Royce Wraith en écoutantAR-AB
Je ne suis pas sur de ce qui a fait que vous avez tous la haine
Mais je suppose que c’est ce que je dois faire pour vous faire rapper
Je veux dire, whoah, je ne peux pas mentir à la ville mec, ils savent ce qu’il se passe
Deuxième etages aTootsiesou les gens me saluent
C’est pour tous ceux qui pensent que je n’écris pas assez
Ils ont juste la rage parce que j’ai la main deMidas
Tu l’aimes alors tu dois lui donner le monde
Est-ce que c’est ta tournée mondiale ou la tournée de ta meuf ?
Je sais que tu dois être un thug pour elle
Ce n’est pas ce qu’elle a voulu dire lorsqu’elle t’a dit de plus l'ouvrir
Ouais, tes doigts sur les détentes se transforment en doigts qui tapent sur ton clavier Twitter
Tu te fais enterrer par un négro qui chante
Je ne suis pas le genre de négro qui irait écrire sur le clavier aux négros
Dédicace à toutes ces patronnes qui entretiennent leurs négros comme si ils étaient leurs femmes
Faites en sortes de faire un accord prénuptial
Ensuite dites à votre mec de se calmer
J’en ai fait un autre, j’en ai fait un autre
Tu n’as toujours rien fait au sujet de l’autre
Je continue à boire des verres l’un après l’autre
Ouais, l’un après l’autre
Je continue à boire des verres l’un après l’autre
Ouais, l’un après l’autre
Je ne veux plus jamais en entendre parler
Même quand elle me diras c'est mieux s'ils restent amis
Même quand tu diras "Drizzy, dis leur encore"
J’ai fait un concert ca a été un événement soldout
Ohh, tu ferais mieux de t'asseoir
Je ne voulais pas le faire, c'est toi qui l'a cherché
Ce que j’essaie de dire c’est que je n'ai jamais eu besoins d'eux
Tu ferais n'importe quoi pour la célébrité ou ta liberté
S’il te plait, vérifie si il n’est pas sur écoute
S’il te plait, s’il te plait ne laisses pas ces négros m'approcher
S’il te plait, réfléchis avant de t’attaquer au meilleur
S’il te plait, qui est un vrai négro et qui n’en est pas un ?
S’il te plait, que quelqu’un m’arrête
Je parle comme un gangster confiant
J’ai le festival dans cinq jours et c’est le mien
Dès que je vais monter sur scènes ils vont me demander si je peux refaire ce son
Ouais, ils les veulent l’un après l’autre
Ils vont me demander si je peux refaire ce morceau
J’ai fait une pause avec mon albumViews, maintenant je suis de retour sur ça négroLady, you say I stay in the house til four
We don't even go out no more
Its always the same eh
Always complainin
Its obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see theres a lot to lose
Cuz we got a baby
And people are shady


My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we denied from the back
You can die where from, or die where you at


Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they don't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good


Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next
Lend me ya kleenex
I'm tellin you baby
I think I'm a bout to cry
Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you
I hope that I see you again... again
Hope that I see you, see you




Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&amp;b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is

Thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good goodIt's 7:58 and now your curfew is pushin
Watch how just like Republicans I'm behind the bushes
"It wasn't me" - if you asked me, that's what I'mma tell ya
And I'mma eat so much chocolate, my blood type's Nutella
Got wanted signs from madd parents, state troopers
Kidnapped Willy Wonka and bitch-slapped an Oompa-Loompa



Give me your Reese's Pieces,give me your Hershey bars
I want your Milky Way,give me that Snickers bar
I would Trick-or-Treat but I'm too old now
So I snatch your bag so I don't look like a pedophile
My sticky fingers got all of these mamas mad at me
We're talking stomach aches, restraining orders, cavities
I probably won't have no teeth when I'm finished
I don't pay for the porcelains, I just marry my dentist

I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is
Chilling in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz
At my show, you won't simply put your hands in the air
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer
Like Baruch Yitadel Yisrael
Ve'et ha Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy
Do not go to Feingold's, though
The pickles are rubber
And I will not be harming ya
I read the Old Testament,okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada
Daddy from Africa
Best of worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya
Challah!It's what you all been waiting for ain't it
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat
Go ahead claim it
I'm about to paint a picture
You niggas go ahead frame it
Since we gettin Seinfeld
On some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck a 54
So it's obvious ya'll gone steady be rollin with some jokers
And me I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn. can you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise your self, go buy a costume
I am making stock works, while you working stock rooms
(ughh) and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers a cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be in your face
Like no speak-a la ingles
Soon as you hear it you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware, and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for ya'll ulterior motives
Cause if you like it ya'll should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a key
Alotta ice, alotta cream like Dickey Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Mishy Me
But I'mma try and have you on the trip with me
Slid in threw a Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex man is a hater officially
Probably cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah that's the reason why he looking hard
Cause I've done snatched the chips ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad cause his girls at the house
With her tongue sticking out
Like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could of been Gotti in the flix
But at this point I'm just poking a body with a stick
Now a days rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skipp
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for this zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just let's me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here baby, they asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, naww not if they pay me
Mr. betcha that's expensive cause it's not a fugazi
Spittin a crock pot of bottemless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasty?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga keep your two cents I ain't trynin leave you broke
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
Something crazy on my arm
And here's another hit barry bondsIt's what you all been waiting for ain't it
You weakly entertainin'
For me to get a hold of this beat
Go ahead claim it
I'mma bout to paint a picture
You niggas go ahead frame it
Since we gettin sinfeld
With that Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from medeocer
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker

So it's obvious ya'll be steady rollin with some jokers
And me? I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn. can you niggas get any broker?

Niggah keep your two cents I ain't trynna leave you broke
Life of a don, lights keep gloown
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
Something crazy on my arm...
And heres another hit Barry BondsHere we Gooo
The 1st time around
I left the cars at the house
And I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go it's bout the rhyme-in Now
I'm seeing it clearer, the season is nearer
And still I must change,I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm out spoken still
They not sure it'll work but their all hoping
He'll emerge the victim,my words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that u heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin' before ya'll
I barely get tired,I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week is What I'm daily required
I'm meetin' qoutas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova
Be in the thrown instead of being ya own
But look


Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin' on the weekend
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit bout to segway to the verse here we go


It's like I'm makin' moves in my city though
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin' to get with me though
Important and vital
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga it's the same thing
All day long
But that's the screw face
Rappers will friend you at 1st but really they two faced
Hoping u trip and slip over your own shoe lace
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not
Play me
I'll never go broke
Fuck em I'm flashin' the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh


Look... I got few days left
And I'm a make use of every single one
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... it's always been the same
It's all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway
I roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin'
Haters will say I'm adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We handin' fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how we're all endin' up
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up
Holla!I’m so fucking dumb, I wear diamonds on my thumbs
There’s a diamond on my dick so there's a diamond on her tongue
I can’t feel you baby cause I'm romantically numb
Emotionally drained. I came here just so I can cum
There's nothing under God's sun that I haven’t done
I got a lot of problems, getting pussy just isn’t one
Girls is like buses: every 15 min. they run
Now they like potato chips: I just cannot have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I don't like your friends in my business
And I don't feel like you deserve a visit
Cause you ain't in the kitchen with me water-whipping


Ok, I’m all about it, all for it
I’m all-star team Jordan, small forward
I’m never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so I’m shooting if I draw for it
What the fuck is up now? Man, I’m in this ho
Life is moving fast: where the fuck do all these minutes go?
Mixtape dropped, then I started getting 10 a show
Now I get a hundred:what the fuck you think I’m in it for?
Young Money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree
"Fuck you" to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout-out to your girlfriend, nigga,lately she distracting me
Wondering if I’m the best? Well-I-am: no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna fuck your niggas
Niggas gotta wanna be you
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
You can say whatever, girl, but we just don’t believe youI'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me


Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team till Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah


I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me


Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'


I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me


Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Motherfuck award shows and motherfuck the press like that


Motherfuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw motherfuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat,believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone


Yeah
This the type of beat, you know I gotta flex
You been talking big but we ain't impressed
Got some game for my age, she know I'm so young, but she know I'm so paid
Believe Me, believe Me
I'm the boy, man, they hate me in the streets
Im the one that you still tryna beat
Better stop the shit, man, you know you can't compete
Believe Me



It's been me and young Benny off the rip
Thats the man that believed in the kid
Got a ticket to your final destination if you tryna trip
Do ya'll really know, really know who ya'll fuck with?
Can't blame me for wondering, in the same whip that I'm stunting in
I been car shopping, stealing my lines, like you bar hopping
I got your girlfriend in the passenger all topless
Nothing to stop this, not even the hoes spreading gossip
I just seen my new car on top Gear, said it drive fast but it handles kinda weird
I mean thats weird, I was ripping but I guess they know better
Your girl stay sending messages like an open letter
HOW do I respond, I feel bad that we don't get along
I mean, I guess that I'm wrong
But why is she so friendly?
You looking for them foamposites, but your direct deposit all pennies
I like Jays, Hermes, all suede
I'm still working like NFL on they off days
Whole team dogs but we don't take in strays
People round me, been loyalty to me since day
1, And 1, where's the defense?
Light hit the wrist and it sparkle like it's sequence
I been doing this, this is all pretense
Better learn to swim cuz your ass is in the deep end
You powder coat and plasti dip, I get the new whip
I make it look like coke and oreos is a good mix
I have you pushing tulips, I treat you like you a nuisance
Talking about my team like you got more than two lips
Don't take it serious now that you got some wealth/
Even if you sinking wouldn't send a boat for help/
I - I- I don't got a yacht. I got a few skies, like
We could hit the slopes or we could hit the beach, like
It's really whatever, whenever your girl down
I could come through and like murder my whole town
Murder like, I be talking about egos
Talk about the whip like thats Leo
He just copped it, spent like 200k
Man, I blow my whole advance in a day
I really don't mind, cause I know in due time
I'll make that all back and it's fine


Rip, Haha, Rip/
Off the rip, had to get it popping off the rip, rip!/
Had to get it popping off the rip, rich young white boy out here talking shit/
Back in the 718 with the 6
Had to cop the Yahmaha word to homie Genc, like that/
Checks bouncing like I'm saving my sessions/
In the bath tub with a bad bitch like the reverend run/
I could put staten on the map, but even if I did ya'll would still hate on that/
They would still talk about me it like it won't get back to my squad/
Sorry I been getting too gone/
Had to cop the GT The MC, it's fully loaded/
If you lease it you ain't own it, well, if she gave me head, did she really blow it?
Same difference, man, I still make the payments
Payment like a mortageg for your family, I would expect you just to hate it
Arti bout to forecast the next 2 years
6-7 zeros is the only thing I FEAR
Thats a lot of money but my brother is my accountant
If its coming cash from the venue, count it!
Even if its too much, man, we all down it
This a fuck you for whoever done doubted
Oh, you doubted me?
You lucky you get my bars for freeShit's all good
The deal got signed
And my split's all good
And these haters pretending
That it's all good
Say that shit in person
Man I wish ya'll would
I'm a mothafucking genius goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you
I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat
If you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket
And these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me
Would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could of fooled me
And tell my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chilling in the cut, nigga what
And I'm feeling like


I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie


Here I go
Street report
Balling over here
We need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house look something like a resort
You can't resist being rich when you record
When this money run slower than Eyore
If your life is a movie you an extra
I'm so fly, I glide Clyde Drexler
Mr. Pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now
Fuck next up

You know a lot of girls be
Thinking my songs are about them, but
This is not to get confused,this one's for you


Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fucking


Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there
(Yup)I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hitting all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chilling with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say, you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working, I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, cause


Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fucking


Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the backand make your fucking bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til the nigga hit the jackpot


Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had

And have fun while we chasin them around
(DAMN WE RAISED SOME BAD ASS KIDS GIRL!!!!)
For as long as I am breathin
I'm a rep for you on everything I love and I believe in
And when these other niggas see you they be always schemin
They ain't knowin I am wearin the crown


Ayo, you the only one that see the real Nicki
I could show you chill Nicki Cause of how you deal wit me
When they knock my blocks down you come and you build with me
Even though you real busy, you's so fuckin real Drizzy
It`s so amazing I figured out this world is ours with the taking
I figured out that when I go out an all those people scream that's some of them are living vicariously through me
That's why I put that "S" on ma chest and I`m gone
But on another note, let's have sex in my dorm
And I'ma make you beg, cause you look pretty when you beggin'
So meet me on the campus, I`ll be there around 11
So let me put my books down, excuse me if I look down
Guess I'm a little nervous, but I'm at your service
Look at what you took down
Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything, other niggas never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
That's why I hold you down, every time you hit me up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
I make you beg for it, until I give it up
You say that same thing, every single time




Sex, Love, Pain, baby I be on that Tank shit

Yea just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back, and make yo fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots

Okay I just got back from another label meeting and
I ain't what they looking for I ain't what they looking for
I ain't really Atlanta I ain't really Brooklyn or
I dont fit the appeal for them shows that they could book him for
Straight nigga tryna get in through a crooked door
Barely fittin in cuz a gimmicks what they took him for
But getting doubted caused me to reroute it
To another destination where the people they abouuut ittt!
You ever felt high above it all?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like I'm rich when I'm about ball
And think once about the clothing that I buy up out the Mall
I'm famous so I get approached fast, Louie and Coach bags
All up in coach class, gem like Topaz, cool like slow Jazz
Dope like coke lines and crack like broke glass
I promise this is me, me



I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you



You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you



Yea
Ok, I'm floating in my zone without a scheduled descend
The rising and the fall was never my intent
I want this shit forever printed in cement
And if I ever sin I promise to repent
I'm only tryin to win I ain't tryna present
You gotta listen close like it's coming through the vent
These rappers can't see me I live behind the tint
And just to get a visual them niggas gotta squint
There I ammmm
Little me in row 23F real reconize real is there none of yall left?
Everybody in the game can't none of yall ref?
And filter out the bullshit the fuck is yall def?
You'r now tuned in to the new comer of this summer
The Chris Paul of this fall exist yall - Yea
And is the realist nigga still I?!
A bitch could love you to death and you still die
Ahhh!



I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit is wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you



You, you, you, you

I wanna thank yall for coming out tonight

I got my man Slakah The Beatchild here
My man Hazel
You already know we about to rock tonight
So if you with me clap ya hands
I'm about to tell you a secret, as long as you can keep it
Between me and youVerse 1: Drake

I love these cold nightsmy breath light and I slide through to your crib
Got my mom's car my phone off cause I don't want to leave here
Girl the moon peakin' the sun leavin' let's watch it disappear
Got the heat on the music low so you all up in my ear
I keep yawnin' and yawnin' like I'm gettin' tired
You keep telling me that I need to head home but I don't gotta work so it's fine
It was just eight but now it's three what happened to the time
It don't even matter we having fun so really girl I don't mind
Got my diamonds all on my neck and all this gal 'o mine on my face
With yo' soft lips and your long hair that go down to your waist
If we fuck now I might pull it I don't care if it's fake
Oh you got to work in the morning girl you might show up late
It's been one hell of a night with you I don't mind it at all
Heard you break hard so I'm prepared to pick up the pieces that fall

(STILL WORKING ON FINISHING THIS)Man, what a time to be alive
You and yours vs. me and mine
Are we talkin' teams? Are we talkin' teams?
Oh, you switchin' sides? Wanna come with me?
Look at the smile on me, look at the owl on me
I do not chase girls, but they run a mile for me
Say she gon' ride for me, I'll buy the tires for you
This game is different
You only get one shot when niggas gon' foul on you
Man, fuck 'em all, man, we want it all
Don't get too involved, we gon' knock you off
And to top it all I'm with all the dogs
It's a new season and we still breathin'


Man, what a time to be alive
I'm drinkin' lean, they thought I died
I run with kidnappers, I'm talkin' 'bout kidnappers
I'm talkin' 'bout murderin' niggas, I'm talkin' 'bout carjackers
You just a battle rapper, I'm an official trapper
Niggas be droppin' subliminals, nigga
They're just some jibber jabber
We take a Mellow Yellow then fill it with red forever-ever
These niggas so jelly, jealous
Man. these niggas get scared they telli'-tellin'
I fuck a check up on everything
I bought some ice when the feds came
I bought that bitch new Celine, I got rings, I got racks like Serena
All of my rings Aquafina, my bitch Aquafina
Pluto and Jupiter, I go to Venus
Fresh out the store but I'm not out the cleaners
Who keepin' score cause these niggas, they losin'


I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yeah
(Gotta be something wrong with you baby)
Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up
(Ohh Yeah)
Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama (Damn)
You're the only one
That's causin me this drama
And then expect favors (Yea)
When you come in town
And I know if I see you garaunteed it's goin down


Cause
Too stay with this girl (Ho!)
You couldn't pay me!
I respect a woman
But this bitch is crazy (Hahaha)
This bitch is crazy (Yea)
This bitch is crazy
I respect a woman (I do)
But this bitch is crazy


She don't even know
That's the craziest part right?
She just oblivious to the whole shit like
And you know like I was sayin sometimes
I gotta get my R&amp;B on you know
I wanna wear the wife beaters
With the slit at the top so
I can tear it easy and all that
I wanna sing in the rain girl
You know what I'm talkin bout
Yea
I need a R&amp;B name too like uh... like uh... like
I don't know I'll think of it
Hey!
Hahaha
You crazy man for real
Ho!
Oh well nigga fuck that ho!
Goddamn
I said it without sayin it manLook nigga I can murder anything
Retro, techno, electro, slow flow, fast flow
Hottest in the metro
I spit hurricanes
Copy that like an echo
On my Flo-Rida shit tell'in everyone to get low
Respect me or die thats the stance that I'm taking
A prince but a story is a legend in the making
Cause few niggas spit it with the temperature of Satan
On my Betty Crocker shit you can say a nigga caking, waiting
Summer opportunity escaping
Right through the cracks of a sticky situation
My balls reach stars tell these niggas who they facing
Who the fuck I gotta battle
Four or five mic rating
The upper echelon
Top of the totem you looking at the best
Tell these magazine to quote em
This next bars for haters you still don't know em
I dont got enough room
So get the fuck off my scrotum
Go for the gusto
Built for the hustle
Mixtape murderer still don't gotta adjust though
Tryna be a mogul like Jay, Puff, or Russell
The floor has warm machines made for Hercules muscle
Nervous, you should be
Born where the hood be
Good be a legend
Baby girl I could be
You can be
Find the exit once you find your panties
It's Black marketATL
Who fucking who with the family, nigga


Know more, ask less
All verses get dummied like crash tests
I say your favorite rappers subpar at best
These whack niggas couldn't find me with an address
Yes, guess who's back at it
Stage an intervention, it's apparent I'm an addict
Balling isn't my hobby it's more like a habit
These niggas acting like every day is the Sabbath
My life move faster then a leopard sprint
Round the world got a lot of spots like leopard print
And I'm fresh like peppermint
Always claim Toronto most of them are scared to represent
Cause success we've never had it
Many came close but never managed to grab it
It must be an omen
The curse so tragic
Til they give me a Grammy
Then poof, black magicI live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd and Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God


Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
Cause that implies that we back from something
If we back from something there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I couldn't give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man


My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I


I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed


Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessedWho else really try to mess with Hollywood Cole
Treating Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
I'm tryin' to tell you something that you prolly should know
This that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow
And ahh, my real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose
I don't get shit confused
I'm not with different crews
We walk the same paths, but got on different shoes
We live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Tell me today's weather
I know they say they good but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
If there's a sight to see I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby, what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say, let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking, these London street lamps got a real glow
Drizzy playin' driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he's a hater baby he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lyin' to the kids, like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. Mary's
But I ain't playin' high school games
Pulling McClarens through a McDonald's drive through lane
I'm too fly, keep it hip-hop like Afu Ra
Girl on that McClaren, you gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swordsKaycee
Now im back niggas know
That i can kill this beat with my flow
Cos i got it all,and I'm gonna be hauling
Cos im bossing
Ok,are you bossing,i dont care wat u gonna be causing
I ain't got time for shit that makes niggas pausing rhymes
I only flow with niggas who keep dropping lines
Niggas like lamar who keep wasting times
I'mma thank ortiz for makin him know he ain't the king of newyork

Chorus
Men im bossing
Men im bossing)x2
I'mma make u cry
You ain't gonna flyhigh
Cause you ain't my reach
Nigga,u just try to steal my vibe
But it ain't gonna happen

Meek mill
Kaycee,dont keep wasting your saliva on lamar
Cause he ain't got vibes

ChorusThis here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I am confident and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedastal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask...


This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask...




Is anything I'm doing Brand New?
New [5x]
Is everything I'm doing to late?
Late [3x]
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, Am I too late?

(Drake)
This here is on some truthful shit
Its seems like everything I do your use to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with!
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damned
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels Like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new

(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(Aye Aye Aye)

(Drake verse 2)
This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you and damn
I can't even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?

(Lil Wayne)
And this is the remix babyweezybaby,drizzy, yung mula babyEven though you're all alone
All alone when I am gone
I just wanna keep you warm
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, yes, I'll be there

Cause when I'm all alone, I think about your face
And how I wanna touch, I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah


I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet
Promise that I won't forget
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, yes, I'll be there

About to board a flight, sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you but I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready?

[Intro](x2)
If you was in a pine box
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep
Cause you are the death of me


Looking in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar,women love when you're my type
And you're winning from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress,Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience, one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat, Capitalize That
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me
A false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
Then he said that he was the same age as... myself
And it didn't help cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathing all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why, the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you're outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive,then I diedShe's got a secret, but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low
Cause you already dropped the bullet and turned it into something major


Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first(And)
Don't rush, go slow,I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close


It's a cabaret(Put on a show, get on the floor)
Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more


Fantasy play the role
And all these new moves that I'd like got me feeling like a stranger
Say my name, do you know
Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we are laying in the Manger




Okay, this just in girl the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long 'til you get off from work,but listen
I got some better positions for you to take in for so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance in it no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya, girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know, I’ll keep a secret for ya


I'm trying to ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in


Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, or it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching our every single move like casinos

Call me Montana, call me Montana
Frenchy Montana

Fresh up out the streets, call me Montana
Hottest out the East, Frenchy Montana


Got this little thing
Stomach's so polluted homie play with my franks
Now I'mma shoot em with the chopper like Omar
I be in a coma,sleeping with them black shades
Say she's in a a coma
Junkie for a woman
Belly for a bag
And I'm about go to see Sosa
Got it in the bag, getting money like the ace
Everybody startin
Black and white Mercedes
SLR McLaren from the gutter where I come
Porsche with the fog lights in case I'm in the swamp
Drove the Bentley drunk
When I saw you knew you’re mine
Looking like a tiger
Anything you want I'm buying
I stand like a cycle



Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on the low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before


That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)


How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
Man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it -- all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next thing,YMCMB (ah)


How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armorall tires
Girl, they love me like I'm Prince, like the new king with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)




How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay)
How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay)

Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?

[Verse: Drake &amp;]
Bring you to the six where I really stay,
Show you why I am the way I am
Tell you what I think my biggest flaw is,?
I try to be consistent, but I can't
have an honest moment wit' you right now,?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
get an honest answer from you right now,
Cause all we ever talk about is me
one more time
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
see you right now, I know the sun is up,?
Sorry, I don't really have a choice
ever make you feel like I'm down for you,?
You do so much more than that for me
finally take the time and open up to you,?
Cause that's the side you never get to see
one more time
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be


Look, like my big bro say I'm goin' in
Olympic pools of money I’m just glad I learned to swim
Cannonball, bitch, I hope the divin' board's sturdy
And I hope when dinner's cold my niggas do not desert me
Ha, and these haters like damn 'em
I gave a lot of women they first ride in the Phantom
And yeah I got a deal now and I'm secure with it
And yet my life is so excitin' I get bored with it
I'm the best one outta my peers
And everybody pray I'm runnin' outta ideas
Pass my Moselys it's all so bright
And I'm the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures man the flow is a collage
Critics have a hard time pointin' out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall
Right out of the sky through the roof of your garage
I'm a...

[Hook: Colin Munroe]x2Uh, yeah man, uh
I feel real good right about now
I feel like im, im making a return
I ain't even been gone yet I ain't even
Taken a leave of absence but I feel like I'm back
Yeah man



Check, I roll with the coalition, when no one listened
I spoke out now niggas is throwing this in
You gassed up, my vehicle low emission
I can enter your field trip with no permission
Slip, i've done it before told ya I run it before
Now the city is mine, and what you thought it would be
Ain't a rapper working harder than me I put my heart in T
Uh, ?,carry the city on my back like a Jansport
Or even in a victor bag, so if you quick to brag then u get clipped to tag
Homie, u make a lot of music niggas ain't feeling
You rappers shouldn't rap, you rappers should paint ceilings
That's why I ain't competitive y'all, cuz deep down I know im much better than y'all
Watchu mean do I actually flow,wanna know if I actually flow just ask V-O
Im tryna make the wrist on my cousin ashley glow till she waken up by someone and it actually snow
Stop snitching if your man seen a killer, you never ever seen it, it can't seem familiar
We keep it on and poppin like the dance scene in Thriller
This the new version fresh prince and andreana miller
And d-10tion the boi-1da
And people focused on keeping the boy under
Probably cuz I don't act like y'all
And I ain't gotta sell crack like y'all
Well not really, I mean I do move crack in a disc form
But thats only because I don't rap like y'all
And now its occurring to them
Its starting to be my friend is reassuring to them
Either that or every verse im referring to them
So catch me in a zone till they leave me alone
Uh, yea, and its down south for the summer ima leave them at home


That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious


I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy

Baby tell me how you feel
They say real girls ain't never perfect
Perfect girls ain't real
I'd agree but I guess we'll just wait and see
Cause I swear you act like perfect is the only way to be
N-N-Nothing matters 'cept for you
Don't let no one out here blind you
Don't remember why you love me
Please allow me to remind you
And I know you left me once
But I came right back to find you
Even though I like being in your past
You got a bright future behind you
Oh, damn, oh
Girl I must admit I look amazing next to you
Girl you crazy, sexy, cool
And you stayed obsessed with school
But that's good
Cause you know that them grades impress me too
And my free days are just for you
But I don't get many
It's like every time we spend time
It feels like the first time
Cause we never spend enough time
You catch me at the worst time
It ain't like you're not worth time
Just I don't control it
But tonight I made it happen,just to celebrate the moment
Give it up one time


Ohhhhhhh
I just wanna celebrate the night with you
I bought some party favors, I'm a light it up if that's alright with you
How you feeling now?
Tryna lay it down
We could count it down
Five, four, three, two, one




Give it up one time
One time
Ce-Ce-Celebrate the moment
Give it up one timeThis a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now? This took dedication
This is meditation,higher education
This the official, competitor elimination
I-I-I-I was taking trips, with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens, to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half, like they flunk they math
Bitches ain't half, cut up crack, up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This is that Run-and-Get-a-Dollar-for-The-Ice-Cream-Cone
Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's, only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers; niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Voila, Sharika
Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Aisha


It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)


Yeah, okay
We made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erica
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga,either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, "Money ain't a thang!"
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game,they know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rap
Wish you niggas good luck, trynna get where I'm at
Straight like that




Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo
Tell me one thing you won't do: settle
Give me one word for your chain: yellow
Pocket full of money, black cars; ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, A.I
Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don't let me hear Shawn Carter, I'm the ballest of the ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, money cases in my place, let's celebrate




What up, Nicki? It's Nasty, yeah
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac,little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life
Happily ever after
Champions

This adderall got me to the ceiling
I think them percocets had me in my feelings
I peel them hundreds on hundreds
I get that  money on money
I get that guala on guala
I get them dollars on dollars
Then throw out them dollars, them bitches gonna holla
I got more style than stylists
I like that money is money is piling
I see that money just piling
I see it's piling and piling and piling
And piling and piling and piling
We do them favors, them bitches do cater
We go fuck models then fuck go fuck neighbors
Fuck all the strippers then we go fuck waitress, yeah


2 in the morning my mind is on you
4 in the morning it still hasn't moved
Hit me to tell me you get off at 10
Come here, I make sure you get off again
Roxx got a case but they get off again
Fuck all the opps and the shots that they send
I let off first then I let off again
You will not hear from them ever again
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Reps Up, you know there a hundred of them
FBGOVO, hundred percent
Don't ask me shit when it come to my set
Don't ask me shit when it come to my set
FBGOVO, hundred percent, yeah
6 summers straight and I run it again


60 naked bitches sitting, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Take it to the head baby, penetration
Money not a problem, you can finger trace it
Drinking on the syrup, taking medications
After this club we just change locations
After this club we just change locations
We don't take it in, we just change locations
We don't take it in, we just change locationsWow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are getting into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all coming, knew they would push a button
East egg hunting, they gotta look for something
Done doing favors for people
Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas having trouble going gold
Turning into some so and so’s that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Corey Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no we eating, niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up


I bought my niggas rollies off of
While these boys was stanky legging
Trust me this information is vital
I’m trying to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s something that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We going live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killing people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up


(Stop, stop, stop, stop....)
Have you seen me?
I’m doing so good
Everytime I leave
Oh, I’m so sorry
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)


You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch ass shit all day long
Industry people....regular people...
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weakThis the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim


Yo, the city is mine(which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!


Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy



After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down

Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now


Mr. Big Dreamsno tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you' talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like (*Andreena harmonizes*)
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say "My baby's famous and I know it" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out


Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of theATF(uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill


Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And "Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest"
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home


Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man
(Yeah man)

They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, "Damn, really? Even Rose Mary? Even Leanne Sealey?"
They said, "Fucking right, they were the first to go", it's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up,new niggas came around, they been waking up
With"I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like "why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home


Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all


I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a mothafucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home




My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say "What up, though?"
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though,I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fucking love
Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit -- I swear it's sounding like home



Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians -- them know it, but them can't do it
Some people still searching for this truth hereI got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost
I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilli willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to
Act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How I am no good so go with the next manBut dog
You don't know me
You don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and
I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out
Nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you
Like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what I meanAnd dog
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places
You have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb
Ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I
Just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard
So I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is
Like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this
Summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows
In tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am
Present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay
Attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl
Don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me "Is that a rose?"
You mean Rosé?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
Your in need of ya own, manVerse 1: Drake

I always wonder why you bother putting makeup on
You don't need it
And even though I always tell you that you're beautiful
I'll repeat it
Cause I don't want no singer, I don't want no model
And I don't want no fashion designer or nothing
I just want your love
I promise you that's more than enough for me
Chorus:
All you gotta do is come real
Shawty what the deal?
Dont think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way (2x)

Verse 2: Kyoko

Baby just because I wanna look good
Don't mean that I ain't real
Not in the least bit
All the clothes and doing of my hair, face, nails
Make me feel good
And I'll keep it up
Im not sayin what you been stayin to me
Ain't exactly
What I need to feel and know
You're the one I'm wearing for
And where I'll always go when I need a real love

Kyoko Chorus:
So stay real
What you make me feel
Is true beauty of the ultimate appeal
And I don't want it any other way (2x)Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something


Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that noila got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something




Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been?
You deserve rounds tonight, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight

Scream out, blat-blat-blat-blatow, how ya like me now?


My nigga Funeral Fab told be back in '03
Rap ain't nothin' but cash, money, bitches, foreign cars and trees
Cristal by the cases, bad bitches by the flocks
I know I promised my niggas I'd never leave the block
But, shit changes
I done been through six Ranges
Hand on the Eagle, yeah I got them Mike Vick fingas
Throwin' bullets on par with the accuracy
Hit your whole faculty, like, ain't nobody jackin' me
Before you do, you be layin' in a box
While Jay kiss that ass goodbye, *mwuah*, locks
First shot, leave the niggas in shock
That second shot, that's when that body drop (Ya heard me?)
And niggas still askin' 'bout Detox
I'll tell you if you tell me who killed Pac
Aight then, I'm at this Pacquiao fight then, with Tyson
The way he's stickin', and movin' the knife, Floyd might win




Testarossa, keep an extra toaster
It's Hub city's finest, respect the mostes
My nigga Game do that, my nigga Tyga do that
Heard about the new cat, I whipped the Range through that
I'm in Toronto, DeMar got a condo
Sittin' courtside with Drake,Hector andRondo
Bitches know my name, it's Lifestyle, she fuck with that
My dick's too big, like my lifestyle, you fuck with that?
Poppin' champagne, we do the damn thing
Standin' on the couch, it's funny Game, that's the campaign
Big in my pocket, Obama on my wrist
At the Ronald Reagan airport, yeah, I'm on my shit
Louis Vuitton luggage, peanut butter with the red wheels
Started when theRED Album dropped, yeah, I'm gettin' head still
In the club, lookin' past you niggas
These bitches gas them niggas, Drizzy, ask them niggas

Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen


I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?"
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue,I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!


Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer,opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"
Off this I'm kinda takin it back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!


And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime


I miss you, most of all, my darling [Beat fades out]
(give me a second to gather my thoughts)
[Fades back in] Strolling in the park (Ho!)
And watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)
(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)
Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)
(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)


I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive


That shit was wack as fuck

I was like, 'You won. Why are you posting your text message?Just chill. Take your W,and if you feel you didn't deserve it, go get better — make better music.It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilt? You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won?

This is how the world works:He made a brand of music that appealed to more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick.Whether people wanna say it's racial, or whether it's just the fact that he tapped into something we can't tap into.That's just how the cards fall.Own your shit

To name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny.No, in that case, you robbed everybody.We all need text messages!I got some shit for you to come and get

I need a girl from Kentucky,I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me, someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift

Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me, I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift

So whatchu want an award or sum'hin?

Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if ya bluffin
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a Monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull ya card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin world records - no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or sum'hin
My deal like Weezy first week, one point sum'hin
...And my verses gettin stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin up, so I'm cuttin off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it dooow-haaaah-owwwn
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass -- PAUSE
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in

If he don't fuck wit y'all, then don't bo-ther him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't fa-ther them
Right, uh


It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin
I always choose dough like it's my only option
...Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off yo' chest~!"
...and I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin, I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office - same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention


Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different"
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time


Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
Yeah, swanging


She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say: "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around


Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
Yeah, swanging


I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'


Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good girl like you're famous
I know I'm late it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girlTake your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top,rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause


Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know




Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
(If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city)You better cuff her like a cop
Every time you see bow wow wow wow come around

Can't keep yo broad, you so lame, damn where yo GAME at
And if we in the club you better cuff yo girl super tight
Cuz it just might be your girl who end up in my room tonight
Big pimpin, no simpin, you know just how I does it

You girl so out of pocket, you know that she be boppin
She know we ballin, so she wants to ride my Houston rocket

I think she wanna give me head, how thoughtful huh
You see me in new york, see me in LA

Might see me in houston, or see me in the bay
But its gonna be hard to see me with that nigga in the way

No I ain't rich, but cuff yo chick by the collar
Cuz if a little nigga like me tryna holla
Then I gaurentee ya'll breakin up tomorrow

Beat it in the bed sheets, and put her in a deep sleep
And when she wake up she always askin for a repeat
I know she rep the "A" but I put her on my B-team
I ain't gonna sell a dream, but the last girl I sold D

Spendin' all my days on the Eastside, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now

Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me

Couple other things I’d rather do than talk 'bout that right now
Told you 'bout givin' him chances on chances on chances

(I threw my hands in the air said show me somethin')
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house, she made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, "when that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me, that my nigga till we gon'
Keeps his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' bout "you gotta leave already?"
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you a little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said "You're mine" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley 4 door already
Even as a boy I was the boy already
So you know that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I'm matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for 3rd Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time cause I've lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime said you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a xan for the boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, another xan for your boy
You would probably fly out to Japan for the boy
You would probably kill another man for the boy
You would probably...
You would probably lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy
(Fring)Ayye Yo DJ Wristpect let's get em'

And tell me go hard well I'm going harder now
Bumpin Shawn Carter cause there ain't a Shawn Carter now, feel me
Get with it,I'm trying to overthrow a nationusing fade to black as a nigga's only motivation

So take me as I am  have nada of me thered stripe on my jacket show you that Prada love me

I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes you aunt Viv
Until you take from me till the point that you can't give
And when I see you out I pass by it's offensive
But what you expect though
Kinda direct yo
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy thats tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cause Now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip
Oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick


Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that y'all believe in
Cause when I say I'm serious you claim you're only teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple years I guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin' waitin' patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cause I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losing a feeling
You losing appealing
You need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick


Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But you was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin' ya thing too
Sayin' to my self you deceiving
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
In fact I know you always be lyin' when u be leavin'
Goin' to visit family promise me you ain't cheatin'
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga
How you think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't
And make u think u get the ass when you really won't
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin' it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin' it
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick


Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)


Feel like uh
I feel like we back man (yeah)
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk aboutWhat you mean I ain’t call you? I hit you when I landed
I’m waiting in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguing more and it’s getting less romantic
Yeah, I think she’ll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I’ll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay, for real
You looking bad, girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I’m willing to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
Yeah but tell them bitches that you’ll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
And every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then I break you off
It’s useless all this fighting let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around


Your wrist and fingers glisten; ice cold like Michigan
Look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listening
Rather run around with them nothing ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killing me, but soon its gon' be killing you
To see her in that two seater, now that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me
By now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released
Into the wind, again, again. and deuces I must throw ya peace


You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I’mma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
I’m stupid but I won’t get my drama on
What I’m dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who” I don’t know who you talking 'bout


According to my old bitch I be on some new shit
She was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch
Think I give two shits? you ain't gonna do shit
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better you’d do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better


Drizzy voice,now I’m ghost baby
Four door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I’m bout my business boys, plus I make paper
Come on that's old news, yesterday’s paper
Oh, you talking, what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut ya mouth
You’ll never score another me, I’ll shut it out
Act like there’s gum in your hair girl, cut it out


Got a pocket full of hundreds
She the only one is missing
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it
Got a racing Lamborghini have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talking ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in the hall of fame
I let my denim sag #red Louis belt
How can you love me baby, first you gotta love yourself


The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
By the seashore,but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for, ain't rich ain't poor
I want it to do more but hell I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousins house to see if I was there
Get ya minds out the gutter man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But shit they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop making sad songs


I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her; to herSipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup my drink with me


Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me


I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you could vouch for me
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely wanna
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance
I know you spend some time putting on some makeup and your outfit but


Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing


You doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You know
How we let it get like this I don't know
But that nigga can't save your soul, nah
Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty
Haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Ungrateful, ungrateful
Your momma be ashamed of you
I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you
Ungrateful
I'm too good for you, too good for you
You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable
Doing me dirty (dirty, dirty)
You're making me nervous
I haven't even heard from you
You look drained, you look exhausted
Girl them late nights ain't good for you
Really starting to show on you
Don't hit me up when it's good for you
UngratefulDiced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya
I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking about no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you whats better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or temporary forevers
Shorty get it together
Diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay 'till you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If its not it baby, hope its progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby, no more talking baby


Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples damn my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh uhh
Sex all night, couple shots of Ciroc
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't the thing baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG them other niggas fell off
Baby girl I just wanna see you well off


Call me crazy -- shit, at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right


Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love,thug passion
Red bottoms,Moncler,high fashion
Belt buckles,door handles,gold plated
Balmain,rich denim, out Vegas
French Riviera baby girl lets take a trip
I'mma trip go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permissionhopefully you'll learn a lesson
I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk
She so fine she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star




Something about her probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour,let me kiss on a fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won’t ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you, let me see, show me proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying eat, we don’t need a spoon

These bitches be naggin the kid
They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed her my racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack on muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a six trey
Chevy, Mercedes I keep em' comin'
Fuck all these bitches I keep em' comin'
I pull up right now I'm parallel
I hit your block with them swangers
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
You don't come around here cause its dangerous
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, that's a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and thats confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that car, trick
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got Bape on my back with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she latch on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom, we did it
I see how they counted us out
Bet they never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin, I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I pulled off before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga do you really mean it
When I was sleepin' on the floor you shoulda seen how they treat me
I pour the Actavis and pop pills so I can fight the demons


These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is, if you get hit you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again, I don’t let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again
And again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I’m Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might gone fit you in on Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that’s making triple what I’m making, what an entrance
That's when you know its a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I


Who's that peekin' in my window
You should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
We can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt, Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi


I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen




Baby, not a day goes by, whoa
Without you on my mind, whoa
Donna Karan underwear
Babe, I swear you have nothing to worry about
Baby, I wanna see what's under there
It's easy, look lemme explain
Oh baby, yeah baby


When you take the picture, cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch 'til I reach third base
And when I get home I'mma hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date
Ye, the picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian, be a lady at it
You know what's a crazy thing
Some girls'll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty-three year old virgin
That's disrespectful baby, don't encourage him
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican, or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress White, but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby you up, question mark
And she respond, YES-S-S-I-R

In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)
Girl, we should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)


Life is great when you’re naked, you press the gas and I break it
I drink liquor don’t chase it and I get women don’t chase ‘em
I’ll put her face in the pillow and watch her bite on the blanket
See you tempted to taste it, get every drop and don’t waste it
I’m fucking with you, I’m fucking with you
The type of dick to make that white girl say ‘’I love that nigga’’
I’ll hit your Instagram and click like on like every picture
You get it from your momma, well then bring ya momma with ya
And lots of liquor, tell her "fuck me like you hate me"
"You love me?" I said maybe
She said "boy don't keep me waiting"
And I say "go down, don't be lazy"
Yeah, now that's my baby, that's my baby
She love me for my drive, I love her cause she drive me crazy
What's up?


More rest and sex is all a nigga needs

OVO I ride, OMO I ride
Reps Up, them my niggas from the Scarborough side
Don’t fuck with them, or hollow tips will fly
I don’t have to lie
Lot of people say it in a song just to say it, man, I’m not that type of guy
Hit me on the cell
I just might bring you to the city, send you home with stories you can never tell
I’m tryna break you out of your shell (And what?)
You just turned 21 like Adele, that’s good with me
I put my business on hold, let me turn off the phone
Let’s explore the unknown
If you not drinking with me you force me to turn up alone
No peer pressure,I just know you like to get in your zone
You say that you’d rather smoke
Well, let me call up OB’s room and tell ‘em roll up a cone
I know he probably got that extra special
I never second guess it
How's Villanova? What classes you taking next semester?
Man, she like "fuck the small talk"
I’m not here to discuss extra credits or my professors
No time for funny stories
It’s funny how she shows up late, but always comes before me
We both young and misguided, but that’s another story, yeah


More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease

But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)
Girl, we should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)I turn the phone off, I let the seat back
I'mma be out for a minute, I'll bring the heat back
The jet-setta and forever will I get chedda
And y'all will only get cash when you get betta
Check luggage, flow to a new city
Plus, the hoodie cover my eyes
I'm too pretty, nah, I'm just playin'
Heavy is how I weigh in
Top floor with a view of the water is what I stay in
But y'all don't hear me, yeah, y'all ain't relatin'
Well, let me tell you what happens when I be datin'
These chicks with ass fully skip they class
Catch me at the hotel and try and get that cash
But, I'm not stupid, nah -- I'm tight fisted
You tryna sex me for money is quite twisted
Prior to fall, I was lying to y'all
So if you gettin' one ring, I'm denyin' ya call


Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doin his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feelin where he's at let him know
He just doin his thing
Gotta love thatWhen a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change


So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too


But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)


We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else





Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it


Tonight I’m into breaking up
Somebody’s home
I’m drunk as ever
I’m not alone, (I I I)
I’m with my people
I know you love it
I don’t just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby forget about it
Im headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it

My judgment's never cloudy
That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I’m polite about it
Baby after you
I’ve had a glass or two so somebody remind me where I am




Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where’d I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I’m the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen
Because everything's easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, still run the committee
NY forever nigga, Diddy



It's a celebration
Clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp
And a glass of moscato
For the girl whose a student
And her friend whose a model
Finished the whole bottle...
And we gonna do it big like this
Yea and he was just practice
He ain't in your world
You can take him off ya atlas
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this outtt
Show me where ya tats is
Show me where ya hands at
Maybe I can grasp it
They say if ya get her you can understand her better
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her
Yea... and I got it together so when they talk they try deter me it's like whatever
... tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself


This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage ya
Especially when you think noone is understanding ya
These girl groups with they overprotective managers
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate
Goodness gracious on top is such a hard place
Yea... but if you never even been there
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in ya swimwear
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air
I know that shit is exhausting girl
And your mistakes are costing girl
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myselfWhy you over there lookin at me
While your man standing right beside ya?
The temporary happiness he might provide ya
But you know and I know, that nobody gon do ya like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line of sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly I'm kinda like
"I don't really wanna hit this girl"
And so she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'mma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playin around
It gets deeper and cold-ER, the funny thing is
I'm writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like...




Look...we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreat thing
But that was then, you know some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus your man still there, let's be fair
You'll do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past, some late night smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he!
Late night's 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, cause I been the other man
And you NOT gonna trap me witcha silly lil plan
It's my bad, shoulda chose a wo-man
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl playin
I'm sayin, you need to do what you do
I'm NOT tryna take it any further with you, C'MON




Uh...uh...I met her at the bar sippin on Patron
And now it's been three years off and on
Cause the same page, we are rarely off and on
Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (c'mon)
We lost contact like Bausch &amp; Lomb
But regained it while she was buildin her house a home
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that, she don't know what to do wit her life
Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute she mad at me, next minute it's all good
And I'm in her body like Gray's Anatomy
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (uh)
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, "Damn, if only her nigga knew", what?

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do


Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1daand Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'mma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a majorlike sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while its cheaper than dinner
Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her




Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations Imma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Ya'll record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here Imma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy



Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper, and that's how we do


Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball

And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!


Stance on lean, leg up on the wall

Do's what you do, I do what I do


Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, you’re clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
It’s like a offensive foul how they running to us
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card
Lord I got ‘em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, plus the eggs and ham
And a pen for any beef trying to approach us
Let the sucker burn, I don’t even flip 'em over
Nickelus F. teamed with Drake, now you mad as hell
Ain’t seen a better looking union since Gabrielle
Well, I'm hot as hell
And I don’t even need a stylist
Spit the infernal like the Real World Challenge
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You’re running up our animals like white boys, they cow-tip
Everybody knows Cap from the south of Wallis
I ain’t gotta use a fist, slap you with the chalice


Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I doVerse 1:
You're ditching school, not in class
Wasting your lazy @$$
Don't even care what will hurt you
But you'll see what this will do
Don't want to work, no need to study
Believe me, this will be heavy
Grades will drop, they'll have the teeth
Of shooting down your expertise
You're now assuming you'll get away with it all, oh yeah
But, the one thing that you'll have to know that should be enough
You know you should face the downside of Seniorit15

Verse 2:
Some of the signs, you have to know
If you slack, you fail the show
Refusing, to complete a problem
One more time, no longer hold 'em, one-sided problem
No longer saved
Cancelled college is riding your wave
Another chance for you
Ain't looking good, no Mountain Dew
You're probably thinking that this is no big deal, oh yeah
However, the closer you get to college, it actually is
(Because) You know you should face the downside of Seniorit15

Facing the Downside of Seniorit15
(x5)

Verse 3:
I know that you're, ready to go
But you're falling, off the boat
Anxious for Prom, making you pumped
But in the end, you'll feel bummed
When you unearth the cost of slacking too soon, oh yeah
The worse you withdraw yourself could pay a lot more
Because you really should face the downside of Seniorit15

Facing the Downside of Seniorit15
(x8)

(END)Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later how am I the man still
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side bitch, we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yellin' out, "Pay the guys"
Man I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you know I had to...


Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard boiled
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill,Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say "Okay if you say so"
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I can never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so and so, where did they go?
They too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it
I mean for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to...oh wait sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
SZN


Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later how am I the man still

Fuck that other side bitch, we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you

Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you know I had to...

Six!Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight and make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down, we gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'm a make it go


Big Poppa, throwing niggas off of cliffs, smoking spliffs
Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls, I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flowing, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight cause the satellite was crispy
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
Ain't got a scar yet
Cause you fucking around with me and my dogs is far fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, trying to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meet, watch for the traitors
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too, all I got is this money, this'll do




I've been up for four days, getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinking how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off man, it's probably true
Cause while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night nigga
I grow tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
But I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stunting hard in his yellow goose
And I'm a motherfucking missed target
But a target none the less and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talking to themselves Hov, hands free
And I'm just filling up this daily planner
Getting busy cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talking in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammer
That's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwing you
Just know that she gonna tell another nigga when she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real meH Star

EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON SWEET THINGNo need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends
Tumblr dreamin' ridin' in a Benz
You don't smoke, but it's cool while you're friends
Silvercity with your girls on the weekend
Seventeen, nights stay out past 10
House party ting turn up with your mans
Arguments all day with your 'rents
Just to go out, gotta fight for this shit
Gotta realize you're a high school girl
Don't matter how you put it, used to fuck niggas
But you don't trust niggas, nah-nah
But you don't trust niggas, nah-nah


Every lost girl I know is over 26
Every lost girl I know is just too afraid to admit it
You give your body to me, I'll body that like a savage
Give and take, you give it to 'em
They take that shit for granted, yeah
Different than it was before
People 'round you want it more
BFF, oh yeah, for sure

Look how good you treated him
You could birth like four of him
Girl, you never needed him


No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with a her friends
No, no, need to pretend
Drama is for you, take that L you lose
Drama is for…
Drama is for…
Take that L, You LoseIf you think ima quit before I die then just shoot me
On my pursuit of happiness and I ain’ttalking the movie
And I ain't talked about getting high either
I’m running the rap game, I’ll never take a breather
These haters be sneezing they must be allergic to my achievements
It’s not my fault that they can’t believe it
But that’s just how it was and that’s just how it’ll be
Nick Steele 4 president, check the box that has meI got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out their heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell 'em I love 'em and don’t ever mean it,we go on dates
I send the Maybach out in neighbourhoods they never seen it
That shit is dangerous but it so convenient
I ain't lying, yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia, some fly shit
It’s sitting at the house like I bought in '96
Cause honestly I’m too fucking busy to drive stick
I swear, too fucking busy,too busy fucking
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn’t
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
I’m in this so but I ain't finished though, it’s been a minute though
My newest girl from back home, got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I’m the greatest my country’s ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled "Surprise!", I wasn't surprised
That's only cause I been waiting on it,nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga, of course




Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympia’s
We talked music for hours she never mentioned ya
Can’t tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB,these niggas make it so hard
To be friendly when I know part of it’s envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga so far these are empty
I take em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ohh, I never seen the car you claim to drive
Well shit I seen it, you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately it went from top 5 to remaining 5
My favorite rappers either lost it or ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down me, Weezy and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I’ll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it’s like a high, and it wasn't a lie
Yeah, just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga

Yeah, look...
Me and sos we from two different walks of life
Usually we understand theres a problem we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green thas sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphins white
Mislead drake that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin like no time
They'll be trynna sub a nigga in like Quizno's


All I need is sum weight, my scale, sum money for bail
A lil booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin heavy on my waist man I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you kno who we are..
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast andI'm good man I'm easy to please

I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the chopperLickwood means "rewind" and gunshot means "forward"
You requested it, so we rewind
Yeah, way, way, way up
Turn it all up, yeah, look


I got enemies,  got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin’ with the kid and pray for your nigga


I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin’ online, that ain’t part of my day
I got real shit poppin’ with my family too

I got niggas that’ll still try fuckin’ me over
I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
But my actin’ days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yeah

I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck
I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall
I keep buyin’ shit, just make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches askin’ me about the code for the Wi-Fi
So they can talk about they Timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain’t really friends
Ex-girl, she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I hear everybody talkin' 'bout what they gon' be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon’ see
I got money in the courts 'til all my niggas are free
'Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales ‘bout how they gon’ run up on me
Well, run up when you see me then and we gon’ see


Nah, fuck all of you niggas, I ain’t finished
Y’all don’t wanna hear me say it’s a go
Y’all don’t wanna see Win Win, 50 or woe
I got real ones livin’ past Kennedy Road
I got real ones wit' me everywhere that I go
I’m tryna tell ya I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Every time I see ‘em, somethin’ wrong with their memory
Tryna take it away from a nigga
So tired of savin’ all these niggas, mayne
Yeah, run 'em


Went from my nigga serving it by the teleto venues in Manchester
Just swerving with Balotellithe fuck are you trying to tell me
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit's embarrassing
They even bring up these niggas make a comparison
They just got to forgive me,this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something
Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city,this shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This is shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know


Can't you talk to me
Let's talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need
Just tell me baby, tell me baby
Sometimes you are, all alone
But there's no doubt
So don't just shut me out
Cause that's not what love's about




Came too far to give up, gotta try
Cause I can't do it on my ownYou’re so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of Toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city. Can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision, and that ultimate responsibility?



Yeah, I mean, I think that for the last week and a half I’ve probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life he’s in. I don’t think that there’s a better way to deal with it than how he just did.I think if we can give out an award at the ESPYS for incredible essay writing, I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he just did was patriotic in its own way, was courageous and was just, to me, I think it’s going to be one of the most historic things of our generation.

I’m just honored to know him and glad that I’ve gotten to, no pun intended, witness this moment for sure. I think it’s an incredible thing.  I actually woke up kind of late today, so I’m just catching on. It’s a great feeling for me. I can’t wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am because he’s been a friend of mine for a long time.



Obviously, you’ve joined Saturday Night Liveand we’ve had Justin Timberlake host the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to the ESPYS than what we’ve seen in the past?



I think obviously one of the talents that I’m able to bring to the ESPYS is music, but I’m just going to get up there and I want to just prepare a great night for people. I think we have prepared an incredible night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music, but I’m not there to put on a strictly music‑based show. Yeah, we definitely have some incredible pre‑tapes. Yeah, I think it’s just going to be a great night overall. I’m there to deliver a great hosting job.



What makes the perfect ESPYS host? We’ve seen some amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer?



Well, I think what makes a perfect ESPYS host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats. But I think most importantly what I bring is the fact that I feel that I know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys I have personal relationships with. I think I’m going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that I don’t know.

To me, it’s just about knowing the room that you’re in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve.



Hosting a sports awards show, what do you feel is music’s role in sports?



Well I said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go. I think that when I speak to any of my friends that play sports they’re always super into music, whether it be rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I’ll obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league, so I think they’re synonymous in that way. We inspire each other, and I think that’s what really ties music and sports together.



This is a question for the producer, and if possible I have a follow‑up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the decision that was so successful for ESPN, was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the ESPYS? Did anybody reach out? Were you close?



No, there was not an attempt to have that be there. And with the decision, it wasn’t something we were looking to have that announcement be on the ESPYS. Certainly if LeBron wanted to announce on the ESPYS, I would have happily had him there. I think what the ESPYS is about is the sports world plays out over the year, and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective, and that’s what you look for the host for.

We’re going to be reflecting on the year, and LeBron is something that happened, so it will definitely be something that we’ll address in the show. But just like in sports, we don’t try to make that news happen. It unfolds.



Drake, in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance, and a lot of times in hip‑hop that’s kind of also a part of rap music and it’s always been. Do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage, whether it be metaphorically or outright in hip‑hop?



I think that’s a funny question. I think it’s a good fit. I definitely think that hip‑hop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for. I think we’re not trying to end people’s careers or make people feel bad in any way, and that’s kind of most of the time what problems in hip‑hop are about. So our night, like I said, is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports.

So, yeah, I think there is definitely a difference. Though being clever with words is being clever with words, so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a bit different.



You’re also being aware of public perception. For instance, you Instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer, right, and you so like you definitely have, I don’t know how to put it, maybe a love triangle thing going on with Skylar and she’ll probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where you’ll mention it like you did with SNL when you did the whole dated Rihanna thing? Everyone loved it, so can we expect that now that you’ll be hosting the ESPYS?



Well, I obviously don’t want to give away the material.But I do have a growing affection for Skylar, and I’m not sure she’ll be able to make it, but I’m sure I’ll give you a treat if you enjoy my past references. I’m sure, if I haven’t done it already, now that I know you’re looking for it, I might stick one in there, for sure. You never know.



One of the things about ESPN and the ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build‑up.  Today, I don’t know if you realize this, but you’ve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that Chris Brown posted up. I just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means?



Well, as far as the latter end of the question, I’d rather not comment on it, but I know that our goal is obviously the night of the ESPYS to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards. I think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet. That’s why I’m excited.

We’ve been working hard, like I said, on the pre‑tapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night, which I can 100% guarantee it will.



Is Cleveland your new favorite sports city? How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins, Manziel, and LB James into your ESPY segment?



First of all, I’d like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks, I do not team jump. I’ve been ‑‑ in the past, I’ve always supported the player and not the institution unless it’s theKentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from.But what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer, whether it comes to football or obviously basketball, I have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams.

So it’s not that I’m team jumping, I’m just a supportive friend.With the recent news, of course I’m going to go ‑‑ of course I’m going to go watch games in Cleveland. If not for LeBron, who like I said has been a brother to me for years, I mean, we’ve got three kids from Toronto on one team, plus we have Manziel who, again, is part of our family and like a brother.

So I definitely have to look into some real estate in Cleveland and maybe make some trips this year. I might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best.

But, yeah, like I said, my teams will always forever be who they are, but, yes, I will support the group that has shifted to Cleveland. I think that for Cleveland, a place that I’ve been time and time again touring, I just think it’s going to be greet. I really would love to see that city grow because they’re just a supportive group of people, and it is a great place, so I’m really excited.



So the ESPYS is your second host gig this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So is hosting something that you’re trying to do more of or are you just working on more music? You have a lot to write about now that you’re a bachelor again.



Well, actually, my status hasn’t changed, just to clear that up. I’ve always been out here coasting. But aside from that, the ESPYS is my main focus like SNL. When I commit to something, I don’t let my focus stray.

So for Maura to give me this opportunity to host, I don’t take it lightly. I put everything on hold to be ‑‑ to give the best performance that I possibly can at this awards show, and then from there, I have things coming up, whether it’s the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne, which is a real thing, which a lot of people don’t know if it’s a real thing or not, but it’s very real and it’s going to be very competitive. And then from there, I’ll figure out the next steps for me.

I’m always working on new music, but the ESPYS is the main focus right now, and we’ll figure out what’s next afterwards.



One thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is you’re a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved the Katt Williams and Lil Wayne.  With having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience, can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show?




Yeah, I’m actually excited to say that I definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance, and that is something that I actually pride in that I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character, especially if I know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms. So, yes, I will be doing impressions during the ESPYS, and they’re good. I’m excited.  They’re great.



Are you bringing your lint roller?



Oh, yes. I think I’ll probably have it somewhere around. Maybe I should. I should bring it out on stage. You shouldn’t have said it on the call. You should have anonymously sent that tip in, maybe we would have used the joke. No, I think I’ll be lint‑free that night. I’ll have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit.



So we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning on the same fashion wearing any Calvin Klein suits, and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what they’re going to wear?



I’m not exactly sure what brands I’m going to be wearing. Right now I’m sort of still, like I said, very focused on the show. I’ll figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers I’ll be wearing. But I’m more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that I’ll be draped in for you all to admire. So that’s really what my main focus is, but I’ll get my suits together.
I’m also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself. I might just cut to somebody and I won’t have to say anything.



You have so many relationships with a lot of athletes. Is there anyone in particular that you haven’t met yet that you’re looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that you’re with already given you any advice about hosting?



Well, I mean, I’ve gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends. You know, one of my mentors who is not an athlete, but obviously Jamie Foxx, a previous host and a big reason why I asked to be a part of this, just because that performance that he gave, I believe he hosted twice or three times, oh, twice, right. It was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music, but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was. So his mentorship and advice has been great to me. Is there anybody that I’m looking forward to meeting?
I mean, yeah, I was going to say, I’ve never met Skylar. I’m sure it will be extremely awkward when I do. But I guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up, which she probably won’t. Her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something. But, yeah, if I ever get to meet her I probably owe her an apology right off the bat. It’s been all in good spirits. But, yeah, that is the one person I’d like to meet.

Just for that last person, I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. Yeah, Nick whatever his name is, because he didn’t win, so that’s how he’s going to be remembered. Nick whatever his name is.



Can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you, and how many are coming from the writing staff? Also, if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song?



Oh, very good double question. Well, for the first part, the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible. We have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady Maura all the way down to the writers and everybody that’s involved. Everyone involved has been incredible to work with. We’ve been at it now for three months, I think, just on and off, meeting and talking and brain storming. As far as ideas being mine, I am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that I submitted are what I’m going to be performing or delivering on Wednesday night. Whether it be music, jokes and pre‑taped pieces, I was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it.

Is writing a joke harder than writing a song? I think that because of the way I write songs which is very honest, raw emotion about my life, I think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because it’s just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding Drake song as the public would deem it.

But, yeah, I mean, all my music is so honest, that sometimes it’s hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself. When you’re able to be lighthearted and joke around, I enjoy it. It comes a little quicker than songs do.



I’d like to make a comment on the collaboration process. Having worked on the show a number of years, one of the things that really resonates in the content is when it’s authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have the access we’ve had to Drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on what’s coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life, it really elevates it, so it’s definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved.

We had a shoot the other day from one of the skits, and on set he was coming up with stuff, and you guys will see it and know what I’m talking about when you see the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It was really like an improv session, and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see. I’m really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show.Uh, I like a long haired, thick redbone
Open up her legs, then filet mignon that pussy
I'mma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in, I'mma own that pussy
Go on, throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to

The V-O-Y I'm talking to you

OK Voyce, we know you was a snitch

Still need a ride, you ain't gettin paid
And Taj got you at them shoots wearing pink shades
OK Voyce, always knew you a bitch
But I ain't know you got down like that


I hear you issuing threats, you need to kill the jive talk
Furthest thing from street bruh, that's why I call you sidewalk
We here waiting, if you stupid then try it
How you gon' knock me out lookin' like Snoop on a diet?
Uh, listen slim fast,we all know that
The only time that you raisin' up the shooters is in the gym class
This ain't dooms day, this today and after
This a diss track from your sister's favorite rapper


Cause everyone you get around got you gas money
And where the cash at? Nigga speakin' of gas money
We all had to give you lifts, isn't that funny?
It's real talk, you know better I don't play that
He told you I'mma liar, I figured that he would say that
But this the same nigga that be talkin' about a Maybach
And can't make a move from his momma house in Ajax


Dawg, I mean, you just shit on everybody, b. And that's ya problem man,Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change

[Hook: Drake] (x2)


I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'mma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own

[Hook: Drake] (x2)

[Outro: Drake] (x2)

Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded

I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded

Staring at my city lights through the plane window as I write this song
Have faith, when I do it
I’ma do it bigger than they think
I dont just flow I over flow I be filling up the sink
Like I left the water on I run this bitch if anybody ask
Ain't much change since high school
Niggas still be in and out of class
S class or the brand new CL5 on them haters
Black paint, chrome trim same color as the logo for the raiders
I just said that cause I'm out in California in the studio with Tez
You should give us credit niggas killin people we can be all doin that instead..
But we not, we just kill the summer every single time I come around
Never chase hoes but we do we laugh at them niggas tryin to run em down
Not I, not me, YMOB,call jaz, call c
Bet both of them would agree
Get viewed, get judged, get booed, get loved
Shit get done round here, do you, not us


Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s made for living
You got to know nothings for sure
Faith in the stars
Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s what I’m given
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds



Once upon a time I met
On this cold explosive dosage she wrote this
But tell me who chose this
Sin city’s innocent really when its inside my mind
And co-sign with a rhyme and a big pen
Once again it’s an even odd
Can’t applaud with one hand
Can’t be God with one fan
Or can you stan you
If not pastor jackson daniels rip that hit that
Now I sip that lightly when I’m on my mic tightly
And I write nightly like Spike Lee
Let me break it down

I been having a maid since the 8th grade with a fade
Rapping by the swings
And the bell never really rings
Class in session there’s no recession
For this upper echelon mic testing its
K-dash-O-S F-R-E-S-H in the place
With a grace in and outta space
Mind that gotta race
Don’t be something that you really not
Sabotage the universal plot
When the planet earth rock gets hot
From the sun don’t get got just get God yeah see that

(Do you believe)

Thought I’d never see the light of day
You can thank me later for the record
I don’t even need it right away
I just really need the right of way
So that I can lane switch
Trust anybody that I came with
They will be here when I ain't rich
I-I-I swear, I know, they are in the boat I row
E’rrybody in it gotta paddle, muthaf-cker won’t let go
I done made a hundred thousand dollarsevery season I was on that show
I’ve been told I was next by a legendary that was on Death Row
It’s a secret, I’ma tell ‘em, rappers only claiming theyget paid
I’ve been gettin love in the club ever since a nigga came in underage
I just put Patron in the pineapple and I do the same with lemonade
Let my money flow through the air, I can make it rain on your parade
I can do it, I can do it and I know the rumours get around
I’ma take my city to the top and then I’ma never let ‘em down
I’ma show a lot of people love, I’ma give ‘em credit where it’s due
Anyone that got it I can do it, this the one I dedicate to you


I’m gon do what I want
Cause this life’s made for living
You got to know nothings for sure
Faith in the stars
I’m gon do what I want
Cause this life’s what I’m given
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds


Cardiac arrest rap tag
Wait a sec, wait a minute, I’ve been in it from beginning
Spinnin’ raps like my heart was a tape deck, yes
I’ve been on the block, freestyling, wylin’ while I was a yout’
Many wonder what the truth it, when the future’s like a tattoo
Gotta make haste while the sun shines
If you only live one time when the spaceships arrive from the skies
I’ll be flyin’, I’m not lyin’ I’m sublime in my alpah state
Let the heart palpitate
Let the soul just astroplane
Here’s a secret, let me tell ‘em
We’re the ones that started rock n roll
Jimi Hendrix, Little Richard, platform shoes and an afro comb
Me ET phone home, BET play my song
Had faith oh so long, thats why we both flowed on so
Ohhhhh, I’m like another message they sent on the bottle
Now people knooooooow…
’bout a freak of nature with a pen and paper
Can’t escape in the ether if you got faith, yeah
See that

Ughhhh…Los…uh-huhhh

Baby girl what's this about
Invite me in and kick me out
Theres better ways to deal with this
Does it offend you that I'm real as shit
Ain't another dude as tough you feel me
I mean who love you like I love you really
Whats up with this distancing
I dont feel significant
Hold up wait girl hold just a min
I need this moment just to vent
Incidents I can't control
Came up out I had to go
You knew I was coming back
You wanted that I had to grow
Said you could get past my past
So what we moving backwards for
Who knew it would take this long
You never mentioned that before
How could you diss me this me
Kiss me dismiss me just leave
Bitch we history mystery
Haunts me how you smile don't miss me
Want me need me call me beep me
Heal me hear me touch me see me feel me
See she guilty look away
Crooked love can't look my way
Took a day to write you this
For night you miss in light of this
Cuz I made it despite of this
Lets make a night of this
Fire lit glass of wine relax your mind we passin time
Ashes from the passions of our passes fly
And its fine
Damn it's time to accept it I never hear your voice again
Its so hard to say goodbye but thats what turns boys to men
The choices in
Life never seem fair
But they bring light to the things never seen there
So at least for the time that it took
When you climb and you look
You done made it to the clean air
Breathe in enjoy it cuz some seek joy just to destroy it
Distorted visions don't playback the way they were recorded
Why can't sometimes life be edited minus all the bullshit
Get a full grip fast forward through the open road
When life push your buttons you dont seem to have remote control
I hope that your soul is safe
I hope all your goals in place
I hope that it goes the way and everything just goes your way
I hope when foes oppose you they get stuck with the frozen face
I hope I can motivate somebody to grow today
I hope that you go hard and even though things dont go your way
Hold up wait

Even though you broke my heart
I'm still wishing you the best
I'm just gonna play my part
If someone's willing to invest
This has been my blood
This has been my tears
This is been a pain I felt inside my heart for years
I been workin so hard I know they gotta feel the bars
This ain't bout no girl this bout the deal I lost

Yeaaa,ey yo check this out
I like to dedicate this song to…
All my failures in life
Everything that I ever endured that just made me stronger…
It made me realize that
It's not the end, it's not where it stops
Anybody could do it…LETS GO!!!

Can I, can I save you from you
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you been sipping
Not suppose to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do(yeah)
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making a mistake I never learned from


I swear I always fall for your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type (yeah oh uh oh)
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all (*4X*)
I believe in people like you


Can I, Can I, save you from you?
Cuz you know there's somethin' missin'
And the champagne that you been sippin'
Not supposed to make you different all the time
Starting to feel, like the wrong thing to do girl
Cuz with all that recognition
It gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from

[Hook: Jamie Foxx] + (Drake)
I swear, I.. al-ways.. fall.. for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why, I.. al-ways.. fall.. for your type
For your type
(I just can't explain this shit at all)
Fall for your type
(I just can't explain this shit at all)
Fall for your type
(I believe in people like you)


So who am I to judge you on the past girl?
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothin' like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
It's too late, I'm al-ready yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break and
End up like before

[Jamie Foxx] + (Drake)
I swear, I.. al-ways.. fall.. for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why, I.. al-ways.. fall.. for your type
For your type


Uh, Yeah
Uh, Look..
Dress hangin' off your shoulder, barely sober
Tellin' me how you movin' away and startin' over
Girl quit playin' you just drunk, you just sayin' shit
And oh you dance? dance like how? like ballet and shit?
Oh, wait.. no I get it girl, I'm wit it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it, damn
Damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like ya second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothin' new except for someone new
But how you s'posed to find the one when anyone'll come wit you
Talkin' to myself but I never listened
Cuz man its been a while and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'mma take you anyway you wanna go, let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again about how wreckless I have been
And I'm slowly runnin' out of all the time that I invested
Makin' all the same mistakes and I'm just tryin' to correct it and I fall

[Hook: Jamie Foxx] + (Drake)
I swear, I.. al-ways.. fall.. for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why, I.. al-ways.. fall.. for your type
For your type
(I just can't explain this shit at all)
Fall for your type
(I just can't expalin this shit at all)
Fall for your type
(I believe in people like you)You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you’re the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together




Well, aren’t you a breath of fresh air?
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like voila, you do it right he might just buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I’m buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&amp;B singer
Naked ring finger,M3 Beamer
Champagne Range,Triple white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&amp;G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti




Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, nails done hair done
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress,girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go


Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
I’m down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, butshout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

Finally back in Toronto, it's better here
I just wanna be anywhere but everywhere
I'm being lazy at the crib kushin' it up
I get enough exercise just pushing my luck
Sitting back thinking damn where did they go
They used to be the ones to watch Ricki Lake show
And now I see em picking up the pieces
One too many starting over speeches
I guess it’s back to me like it always was
Me and the OVO set like it always was
A little money on the counter I left for my girl
With a note I’m trying to see the rest of the world
It all looked so amazing when we were growing up
Used to sit back and say I know I’ll get a model one day
But all the money and the rap game slow as fuck
And all the models from the hood, Project Runway
Yeah, it’s whatever
You know
Feeling good
Living better
But it’s evident that nothing can prepare us for certain moments that you just gotta cherish
Like this young girl had my lyrics tatted on her arm last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I been here before, huh?
Yeah, I still got ten years to go, huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alrightShe dont need to help none
She got her own paper
She dont need you to taker her
On a shopping spreee
My girl ?
For some gucci huh
For someLouishuh
She got the best of everything
You can never report a fancy girl like me




Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, nails done hair done
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go


Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
I’m down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune,but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro?What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works,that ain't that how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine


Dont believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me


(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me,40,O,andNikin a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open




Look, fuck all y'all,we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires,welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even know I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything

DJ Khaled!
The streets is fed up (who else nigga?)
We fed up (We The Best)
The Runners, Usher, talk to 'em

[Hook: Usher]
It was all a dream,yeah homie I'm on my job
And you can't take that away from me
Yeah I got my team, and I got all of my niggas behind me
And they give me the love I need
Yeah I got my foot in the door, still hustling for more
Checking the game, yeah I'm back in the life
Yeah I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired


I am absolutely, positively on my grizzy
Even though I'm sick and I'm tired, I gets busy
Started a 62, but it ended up a frisbee
And me, I like to stand at the stove until I'm dizzy
Ball so hard it's like I brought the game with me
Left my glove so white you thought I brought Jermaine with me
'Bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me
I give it all up before I let the fame get me
I got niggas tryin' to sue me,bitches tryin' to do me
Way these niggas actin', you'da thought they never knew me
But these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me
I'm fed up, it's why I'm actin' like the old me




I'm sick and tired of you suckers so now I'm fed up
Somebody catch the chain, I'm 'bout to tear his head off
Shawty bendin' over knowin' I'm 'bout to tear it up
Before you let your top back,get your bread up
Made history, but now we claimin' victory
Get ya out da white house; go back to your efficiencies
Suckers feel me and I know you haters hear me
Like the IRS, you wonder what I'm makin, yearly!
With them brown bags circulate, so I perpetrate
We shinin' than the bottom cause we're down to twerkulate
Lookin' at the parking lot; better get your mind right
I hope you fed up being broke because the times right
Ross!




Ugh, me and Wayne was gettin' high on 'em
He leaned over and told me just don't retire on 'em
And when they give ya they shoulders, never cry on 'em
And when they love you to death, just never die on 'em
And the question still remains
Have I counted all the money that I've managed to obtain?
Niggas dedicatin' overtime to damagin' my name
And somehow I'm still the hottest motherfucker in the game


(I’m happy to be back man)I’m tired of these haters
That’s why I go hard like A.C. Slater
Weezy Baby here, y’all pre-natal
I just get the beat andmurk it out like Fredo
Uhh I’m sick of bein' criticized
That’s why I’m higher than the Star Trek Enterprise
I do it big don’t, get mad cause you minimized
I keep a red flag in case I get penalized
Uh, it's Young Money like you didn’t know
Stop playin', I hit Drizzy with the give-and-go
It was all a dream, now we the dream team
Who trying to see us? You seein' things
Hustle like I still pay rent man
Got a chest full of heart, no tin man
Uh, Kha-Kha-Khaled I’m fed up
Flow wake the dead up, Weezy, yeah


Yeah, hop out, I been in this, been breakin records since '94
So I ain't gotta brag about records that I’ve broke
Records that I hold and records that I’ve sold
And I’m fed up with these niggas relieving my lingo(yeah)
Don’t bite the hand of your provider
Cause man if I ain't influenced you, you a liar
I’m on fire, you just a biter
You need to wake up and realize it was all a dream

Junior high played them
High school played them
College well, you know... played them
Me and my friends use to laugh about it,how we fade 'em
Now cupid is aiming his arrow right there at me
No more nonchalence can I be, with you here starring at me
With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever seen
You pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries


All them men before me did shit I would never do
And I know you got your guards up, but they should let him through
Just keep fightin' for our lovin' baby, I'll defend it too
And if they try and tell me time is money I'd spend it with you
I spend it all
I spend it all
I charge forever, to my card
And pay it off, no interest lost
I be right here, and like your favorite wine girl
I'm worth trying,but take it easy on me
Cuz this my first time




Now baby, baaaby
You doin' things with my heart ain't never felt, it's so crazy
(?) if you gonna let it change me, I was so mistaken
Your love like a billy coupe, took me out of a Mercedes
Now baby, baaby
For so long I miss somebody
My heart just couldn't (?)
I went from not wanting a girlfriend to needing ya lady
I didn't think I'd ever see
Me callin' to you, you voice before, I go to sleep




I ain't never looked into a woman's eye worth of fire
Bet I'm feelin while you holdin' me begging to take you higher
For so long I wasn't faded, I couldn't admitted before
But now I see what life's about, and I'm never goin' let you go
Girl I'm growin' (don't wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable)
I see us growing (?) don't wanna miss out on a feeling I never had before
I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know
What you'da done to me, I gotta let'em know




Two hearts, I use to say

This track is the finale, nah this the genesis
Young Money murderers, we killin' shit
Forever


Toronto, Drizzy, get ‘em


Alright I got this, you can never get this
I built it up from nothin'
You would think I'm playin' Tetris
Thousand-dollar sweater on but I don’t never sweat shit
Swear the beats they give me got a motherfuckin’ death wish
Yeah, tell me who controls kings
I don't follow rules, stupid old things
I'm flyin' through the city in a coupe with those wings
My team deserves some motherfuckin' Super Bowl rings, Young Money


I'm so in this bitch
CEO in this bitch
Lil Weezystand tall, tippy-toe in this bitch
Blood Gang, motherfucka da da doe in this bitch

Uh, makin' deposits till I fuckin' faint
New Orleans, nigga, how about them fuckin' Saints
It's tight on our end, call that Bubba Franks
Matter of fact it's too tight, add a couple links

Babby gurl yo cousins pritty fine
Prolly gonna dump you fo her(SQWUAHAHH)
Jkay lol not gonna do that
Cause baby youre finer than her, and she fine





Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame,you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks


Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before, but won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means


I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could of predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night
It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden these gossip blogs want to cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
What an experience, you could of been the one
But it wasn't that serious,there was smoke in the air before
That was me clearing it that felt good
All in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks




Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

It's over 25 girls in my section
Lets make a movie tonight, you won't regret it
Fo real, fo real
You know the money bring the cars, the cars bring the hoes
Rockstar life, that's how it goes
Fo real, fo real


Who got that drink, hell yeah who got that drink
They wanna pop champagne, yeah they wanna drink
Fo real, fo real


They wish they were rockstars like us
I bet you they wish they could get fly like us
The same gang of niggas in here with money on us
We got them mollies in here,they mix that Xan and that Tuss
Ain’t go to church this Sunday but I had church
I paid my tithes with them strippers, bought the bitch a purse
I’m on a whole 'nother planet, never on the Earth
I brought my whole hood with me and we goin’ berserk




Even though I used to act, man, this shit is not a act, nigga
I have never lied on a track, only facts, nigga
A lot of people willin’ to back that, and if you backtrack
I spoke about this comin’ to fruition in my raps, nigga
Yeah; then it happened, nigga, wassup, nigga?
You just jealous, you just bitter, shut the fuck up
This that I’ve been on the roll shit, I’m back on my old shit
416, we know your bitch, that Free Band OVO shit, fo’ real




I be splurgin’, Christian Dior, I got Chanel on order
I met that girl and had to spoil her ‘cause that girl’s so loyal
I met her when she was a dime and turned into a quarter
We drank champagne just like it’s water, drink that lean like water
They told me hold back, that’s when I went hard
I bought some guns, I bought some ice and bought some more lawyers
You try and take what I done sacrificed and worked hard for
I’m in that mode, I’m in that zone like when a nigga raw
I’m celebratin’ every day, goddamn it I could be starvin’
Let’s have a toast to all my niggas runnin’ up in apartments
We had a good year this year, we made a lot of fortunes
And we very fortunate

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, man


Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a countrywide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches



Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button"What?" nothin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world likeMichelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me
No you fucking wasn't
Um, you're such a fucking loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my Granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back



Okay, hello it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever,wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for
This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side,you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil' Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last uh



There they go, packin' stadiumsas Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke,his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up outta of our mouths,now rewind it
Pay back mothafucka for the way that you got at me
How's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

Faggots take off your ball gowns
It's balls to the wall now
You wanna be emcees are like bozos
A bunch of motherfuckin' clowns
Me and my bro Vido know what you homos is all about
Just because you got a cosign you think you the shit now
If that's whats ya definition of flying high is i'm turning the plane around
And drivin' it straight into the ground, but the crash won't even make a sound
Because it's goin' straight into the ocean where the sharks will eat you pussies out (2x)
How, how could you be rappin' with a dick up in ya mouth, because when I hear you spit
Nothing really ever comes out
Just a bunch a stupid shit that sounds like "gawt gawt gawt"
And if you try to touch me with that shit, i'm gonna be like "pow pow pow"
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches




Last name the Man
First name Vido
It's bullshit yo when the critics think i'm Dido
Yeah I gut some guts and all that shit so
I'll rip your intestines and make some biffo
Yes i'm gettin' wiser and now i'm gettin' older
But no matter what I has a chip on my shoulder
My heart is pretty warm but my deeds are colder
Yes i'm bad, i'm a super bad ass
A super bad shman, shwith all this cash
Havin' fun with this fine, fine lass
I kick ass to whoever always sass
Got no respect well then I neglect
I snap necks then get slapped on the pecks
Pecks so checked they'll protect ya neck
Haters talk shit then there in debt
Always talk shit, just admit i'm sick
All you shiznits stay away from my clique
Stay away or you'll get hit
Stay away from my ass
Or my ass is all ya gonna sniff

Tell a bad bitch, "Girl let's go hang", you know me: Rolex, gold chain
Fuck with my young niggas, XO gang,get so drunk you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range,I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches,Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it backso I'm all in with these new flows
New flows got new flows,rap is stress, but it pays great
Pimp flows and screw flows, my shit is sounding like grey tapes
Let me go on and hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast so give me anything to make shit go slow
Money in my safe but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change but I don't really see no change in us


I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
Simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker free no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
My mama still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playing
Tap dance to my drum roll
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolled




I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you, there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up with some old shit to drivers opening doors
This my town if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money,get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all, that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I just give everybody a piece of this and make due with what's left
Yeah I do this shit to the death, yeah I do this shit til I'm gone
I told you it's our world, you foolish thinking I'm wrong
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let these niggas know it's real, what's up

D-D-Do That
(Chorus)
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
Cause we can do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
Cuz we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

1st verse:
Focus on women then you get less done
Its light work flow its heavy like a wet sponge
Im gettin rich caue I think being broke is less fun
Celebratin Fathers day everyday so dont get sonned
Where you tryna go im ready
Pick any place in the world the dough is comin in steady
Im chillen out with T and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it you say something about it, I doubt it
I got this gucci wallet I do not leave home without it
Im bout it , im bout itIm standing in on these couches Sayin'
"Bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch! "
Pardon me that was rude
If you just started balling I say im bout to conclude
What more is there to do
And why I would pretend
She call me and I hit it everytime like 'SEND' (damn)

(Chorus)

2nd verse:
Me and 40 whilin', stylin'
Somehwere on the island
Lay her down and fold her like that shit a put a file in
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'
And im callin your bluff
Dont act like you can't see my dialin
Never embelish belive em cause he ain't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asist
Never been a believer that previoiusly exist
I wonder what I be doin when prevously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's,right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Dont I treat you better than your ooo-old man
Hecouldn't have done it this sho' nuff
I tend to dro puff
Im throwed and im high
I guess im throwed up
Tone it all down
My nigga grow up
And tell me when you start getting paid to show up ..dammn

(Chorus)What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...


I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love


I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?


I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love


Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong,that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?


I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love


I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Call the clique Columbine, cause they all killers
No competition, but this election of model missis
Call her sick, cause her head game vicious
All I wish is, that I had a Swisher with marijuana
Faded off the Usher Raymond, girl you make me wanna
Lick you from your neck, to your ill nana
Taste so good it make you wanna slap your momma
God damn (got damn), I love (I love), that pussy poppin'
I’m throwin' hunnads, like yeah (like yeah)
It’s nothin' (it's nothin'),California show you niggas how to function
Scrap away the ass and my leopard all time
They call me Frankie Roosevelt cause all I fuck is dimes
Say you got a man and baby that’s fine
Yeah you got his name tatted, but tonight that pussy mine
I go on and on and on and on yeah
I'mma feel this liquor in the morning
Both my chick and whip is foreign
You struggle to pay the rent, I’m payin the mortgage, bitch!

Turn down (turn down), all the lights (all the lights)
Trynna set the mood, bitch don’t kill my vibe (my vibe)
You wanna fly (wanna fly), take a ride (take a ride)
And I’ll take you higher than I
You belong in the sky, shinin' (shinin')
Your beauty is forever like diamonds (diamonds)
Timeless, oohoohohoh

Shit got damn, sexy motherfucker, let me take you to the head
Take you to the crib, lay you in the bed
Wake up in the morning, fuck you good again


I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem (3x)

I keep taking you niggas bitches, that's my fuckin problem
My nigga we could light it up if you're tryna solve 'em[Hook: 2 Chainz,]

Hold up, bitches simmer down
Taking hella long, bitch give it to me now
Make that thing pop like a semi or a nine
Ooh baby like it raw with the shimmy shimmy ya
Huh, A$AP get like me
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me
Put the chrome to your dome, make you sweat like Keith
Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga nigga, like how you figure?
Getting figures and fuckin' bitches,she rolling Swishers
Brought her bitches,I brought my niggas, they getting bent up off the liquor
She love my licorice, I let her lick it
They say money make a nigga act nigger-ish
But least a nigga nigga rich
I be fucking broads like I be fucking bored
Turn a dyke bitch out, have her fucking boys, beast

[Hook: 2 Chainz,]
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem

And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem



Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you've been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju.. (Okay, I got it)
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes Lord,I don't really say this often
But this long dick nigga ain't for the long talkin',I'm beast

[Hook: 2 Chainz,]
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem



Uh, yeah ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz is to me, just a car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya, beast

[Hook: 2 Chainz,]
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem

And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, I'm such a savage it's ridiculous
Show me a bad bitch and I'll give her a dick to kiss
Tell her tongue it down, throat emphasis
Give me brain 'til her brain can't remember shit
I make it summer rain though she got December dick
Let her states remain and I leave my name in it
I mean I put my name on it
Got a picture perfect pussy, I'mma put a frame on it
I keep it so a hundred but positions change on it
She told me how she want it, her face I came on it
I'm never disappointed, I left her disjointed
Pancakes and eggs with some head in the morning
They say money make a nigga act nigger-ish
White hoes love nigga dick
Don't know why I always got another nigga's bitch
But I bet I'll always put it in her ribs, I beast

I remember, being young, dumb, looking for the next thrill
Angry adolescents, three things on our minds
Money, murder and you

[Hook: 2 Chainz,&amp;]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem




Picture perfect, uh huh
And I paint a perfect picture, my intention's to get richer
But I ain't tryna split the profit with ya
Every pocket on me bleeds, I'm a selfish ass nigga
Mmm, deuces up, black coupes is us
Or maybe the white on white, Klux and Klux
Head all in the bathroom
Beg for it, I'll be back soon
Fuckin' problem, fuck your problems
I got my own but one ain't a dollar
I got five phones for five different reasons
London, Tasha, Mya, Keisha
Courtney, blue-eyed devils with no Visas
Overseas, high heels, wine and pizza
Overdosed on bad bitches, I swear
One on both arm but need two pair, I beast



We the greatest ever nigga
MMG, yeah


I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah I like to fuck I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
If finding somebody real is your fucking problem
Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it


Here it come, there it goes, guess I'm rolling up the marijuana
Well known as the boss,it's the bottle popping
Talking (?) she wanna ball like Cyndi Lauper
I get the cheddar here, baby girl a blood but she kinda cute
Let a nigga gang bang in the found blue (Su-woo)
Red beamer and it's brand new
So shout out to the bitches we done ran through
True connoisseur carnivores, to the whores
Yeah you running with the flow, it wasn't yours
All the boss got butter, it's all gold
Stalley showed it to me first now fast forward
The land lord my influence, is speaking Jewish
Need to get you some insurance for smoking too much
This shit a movie pick a theater in the crib
And you know I got the pole,we get it in, we get it in



Speeding in my fast car,reminiscing on the girl that I last saw
And how she cut wood like a hacksaw, wax on wax off man that ass soft
Attached to my fitted, but I get that kitten hat soft
I was jimmy hat strapped when I fell up in that cat: pause
All over my body, me on for my yoning balls had the head down
Tails up like a coin toss rolling up a body
Stretching like Pilate,110 Maserati
Burning down the highway, burning on some Marley
Could this be love infatuation of the body?
The facts is that I'm sloppy with my feelings and it's got me
Chasing love at six in the morning, horny as a dog in heat chasing after pony
The streets is lonely, but it's just me and the stars
Me and my thoughts, could it be me and the Goddess?
Well if I play my cards right, tarot cards on my dashboard if they re-write
Or leave me right back to my queen tonight, right?

Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down,get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same


I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know


And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same


I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know


Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money


This the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before


Future by lil young blood

Future time baby
Todays the past
Tomorrows the future
I saw my life flash before my eyes
The future is gonna be great
I’ll have no one to hate
I have fate for my future
I’ve been late for class
My grass will soon will soon be green
I’m gonna be living in big houses
Dreams will be fulfilled
Sometimes dreams are killed
I’ll have my own sponsors
Saying you don’t need dreams to live it up
I’ll soon be an all star
(VERSE 1)
My future with the cars
I’ll be glorious with all my glory
All I’ll care about is the money and the girl I’m with
Don’t forget the family that raised me
I’ll keep the sunshine
Average people will get the rainstorm
(END OF VERSE 1)
I’ll soon have the world over my head
My girl has been in my bed
My rhythm and beat would
Take me to the big times
I will never do drugs
I fucking hat thugs
Receiving all that attention
Feels all happy inside
Everyone will love me
Kids will look up to me
Girls would wish to be with me
Boys will try to be like me
No niggas that will only be for Halloween
Haha
(VERSE TO END THE SONG)
My future with the cars
I’ll be glorious with all my glory
All I’ll care about will be the money
And the girl I’m with
Nigga don’t forget about my family
(END OF SONG)Yeahhh
Tay you know, you know I told you many times you my favorite rapper right?
I'mma start this off like you would do it
Uhh
Shout out to DJ Wrispect
October's Own!
Drizzy!
Hehe
Here I go!
Uhh



Look I stands out
So don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, ask apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled, "Hey bitches!"
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of O.V.O
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
Should I hold back on addressing the lame
Because they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And every since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he bald like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it
And all you talking ass niggas get over it
And all you people that be hating get over it
And all you women that I fucked get over it
And yea I'm turning 22 get over it
You know you got to hear my records get over it
My whole team getting rich get over it
I got the city on my back get over it
Get over it, get over it


DJ Wrispect
Little Brother
Pooh, 'Te
Big doe I see you homie

Here I goI tell patron truths, i tell you henny lies

I could put you on this side of town flight
&amp; either drive or pick you up girl, what that sound like (sound like)
I guess big big money, all this money
I don't even know what to call this honey
Takes so long just to get to the point where you're rich and you're there and its all so funny
I stunt so they can see me, &amp; therefore they should know
They call me Drizzy baby, wanna see you 'make it go'


She can make it go
Bring it high, bring it down, take it low, then make it go
She can make it go; start off going fast but then she take it slow, take it slow
She can make it..
She make it &amp; it sound like (sound like)
She make it, &amp; it sound like (LIKE)
She make it, &amp; it sound like (sound like)
She make it, &amp; it sound like: (sound like)(sound like)
UhLook, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain’t no different
These days it’s hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I’ve been avoiding commitment
That’s why I’m in this position
I’m scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name


Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you


Yeah
Uh
Say my name, say my name
‘Cause those other men are practice
And this ain’t no time for actin’
And this ain’t no time for games
And this ain’t no time for uncertainty
And this ain’t no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin’ some shit when I’m in the zone
This is why I’ve been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I’m just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that’ll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
‘Cause we don’t wanna hide no more
Plus you’re not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I’m not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

Look, I know girls love Rihanna,girls love to play with your mindset
Girls always find out the business, and baby you ain't no different
I think I've met a few women, who know the meaning of winning
So I'mma take on
And leave here, cause girl we don't have to be here
I'm 'bout to let somebody
In on this, old friend, she is new friends
She knows me from way back when I
Know she knows my ways
The way I was from way back then, these people won't believe the years
We've spent before as friends, now we're together she can say




Yeah, uh... Say my name, say my name, cause those other men are practice
And this ain’t no time for actin’, and this ain’t no time for games
And this ain’t no time for uncertainty, and this ain’t no time for locking your phone
And not coming home and startin’ some shit when I’m in the zone
This is why I’ve been saying, "no new friends, no no no"
You know how this shit goes, this is not four years ago
Time escapes me, now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I’m just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that’ll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with cause we don’t wanna hide no more
Plus you’re not shy no more; neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I’m not alone, even though +Nothing Was The Same+
Let me get your ass alone, let me make you say my name, say my name

Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me, Trey's girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
Andall these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
But you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best


(It's The Prince, look here)
Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Henessy
Straight with no cubes
Take me where the women be
I won't lose
Drake take Patrón to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? they call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena
I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya

I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store clothes
And blow the fee from my last 4 shows
I do one song and use four flows
She use to be a Christian before
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me &amp; the salesman build a rapport so
He understands the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash only, transactions homie
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dnt know I bought it
I been doin this for years homie, thoroughly I thought it
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track admitting most of my Currency’s imported
But too late now, it too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if they're were acts that I did commit
Repeat offender,Anita Baker
Playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
I gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A real Menschkeit as they say he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present every regal memeber
The coalition, is so efficient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Use to record in the basement that rennie grew his piff in
When pops turned over the keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen'
'til I mention I wanna play a new position
No team playin', no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'
The take over, the break's over, NIGGA
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I'm equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate something
I try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
They condo that I just purchased is sound vacant
Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for lifeI am not a human, shout to all my moon men
Yeah they call me Tune,got them bitches tuned in
It's a crazy world, so I stay in mine
And niggas don’t cross the line, niggas stay in line
Like welfare, I stay elsewhere
Hotter than a devil? Nigga, hell yeah
Rock-a-bye baby, homicide baby
That's more tear drops, call me cry baby
What you talking 'bout? Tell it to my 9
Cut your tongue out, mail it to your moms
I’m a young God, swagger unflawed
Bitch, I'm in the building, you in the front yard
Life's a bitch, naw, better yet a dumb broad
And I bet I can fuck the world and make it cum hard
Yeah, you boys is washed up
And I’m shitting on 'em like two girls and one cup
Weezy Baby aka Bring The Money Home
Pull out the AK and pop you in your funny bone
Laugh now, die later muthafucka
You's a bitch like Zeta Phi Beta muthafucka


Man I’m so tired of balling, I sleep a lot now
I’ll let my goons rush ya like Moscow
Gun at your eyebrow: pow pow!
Man I ball hard even with five fouls
Yeah, we in this bitch like tampons
Dump you in the woods, now get your camp on
Chokehold around this shit cause I’m so hands-on
I get high as fuck and Polo sheets is what I lands on
Back against the wall, my two feet is what I stand on
Diva in the room, she blowing me just like a band horn
Got her on her knees, the same knees that she be praying on
Now she just text her girlfriend with a capital: "You can join"
Yeah, what y’all wanna do? I’m all ears
Smoking on that headband, call that shit Paul Pierce
I’m just so ahead of my time like dog years
Balled like Solange, India Arie, Britney Spears




I am spending much more than I’m making
On these cars and these vacations,is that too much information?
I just bought a Lamborghini, I'm not even into racing
With a windshield full of tickets cause I live right by the station
I am tryna figure out why you so mad at me
Yes, I’m with Young Money, tell the magazine stop asking me
I be with the dread with the tattoos on his head
And a flag the color red like a fucking low battery
(Okay)Nigga peep the shit I’m wyling on
I be with your baby mama, you be with your child at home
Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of styrofoam
Big cheese big bread call that shit a calzone
(Okay)I will break your fucking collar bone
Us against the world,better pick which fucking side you on
Wayne got a Bugatti that he steady putting mileage on
And we about to kill 'em, C4, Mr. Carter's home


Yeah, I call it how I see ya
I wish I never met ya, I wouldn’t wanna be ya
We some asshole niggas, call us diarrhea
The money keep growing, yep, it's growing like a Chia
Yeah, I call it how I see it
Y’all some pussy ass niggas: we should call ya gonorrhea
You keep talking that shit, I’ma see ya
Kill your senorita and and your fucking Mama MiaSince Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna
And put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man
Respect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10
We don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There's missing women out there, we should focus on 'em
This song is dedicated to Natalie Holloway
I feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter,pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya
You want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya
You ain't saying nothing, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air
Cause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair


Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with
Do it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of,you got it girl
This song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree in 10 years
Who's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches, know I’m coming straight to you good girl




Drizzy, I'm sitting here watching Basketball Wives
Like, "uhh, them is basketball wives?"
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes' chick
Can't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date
I pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass "get on!"
Disrespect my chick, that type of shit'll get you spit on
I don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like "hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy's world"
Get busy girl, drink that rosé 'till you're dizzy girl
She walking around the club all lost, like where is he girl?
He on the top of the charts, next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Don spray
That’s your girl? nigga go on and make her cry
Soon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche like "let's ride"




Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man
And thats my nigga Swizzy,know you see Game and Drizzy
Surrounded by them diamonds, I'mma cold mackin
Nigga its a cold climate, don’t ask me where the crime went
Just tell me where them dimes went
So I can get em fitted, let em beat a bridesmaid at the wedding for my niggas
Yeah I’m married to the game
And she married to my chain,watching Boyz n The Hood
Lets take a drive down memory laneYeah (Word!)
Yeah man (What?)
(Love me) It’s Drizzy baby (Mayday!)
You know what it is, from T-Dot to the world
My man Rebstar (Rebstar!),T-Williams (Yeah!), Boi-1da


Look, I know you miss me, go on admit it girl
Cause everything he doing for you, I done did it girl
So call me up late, I know you with it girl
I get a rush from it, knowing you commited girl
Beach front properties, panoramic views
You could probably catch him in Atlanta with his crew
Plus his whole vibe like candles and a pool
Cause he’s hot, but you notice how he handles it is cool
The name is Drake dawg, I came here solo
The smell is Dolce, the drawers is Polo
The DJs Future,the clothes is Ransom
The cut’s from J-Mac,ya boy is handsome
Pay me now, nigga cash advance him
Y’all don’t wanna see me throw no tantrum
We blowing up this year, it’s called expansion
Now everybody get to dancing to this, ah…..


I’m trying to make sure that you feel right
Cause you already know what it be like
Well dressed for the evening
Party hard like we ain’t leaving
Now let’s have a toast to the good life (Uh, huh)
Go ahead and keep drinks coming all night
Shoutout to the DJ, now please let me down here tonight
The way this make you feel, say oohhh
Tonight, the way
This make you feel, say oohhh
Toast to the good life…


My lawyer J-Money, but it’s not important
She seen the videos, but she don’t know my story
Army greens sneaks, homie GI Jordan
On another time zone, we party ’till the morning
My man looking up to me, he ’bout to sneeze
And she treating me like I be New Year’s Eve
Counting down the seconds untill she sees me (5, 4, 3, 2)
One time for the women that wound up with Megan Fox
Two times for the ladies that never use Photoshop
Them other girls, they so vanilla
You gotta certain je ne sais quoi
They need to get their French up to par
And, uh, pardon me for asking
Anything I want, I must have it
I make it happen, poof, magic




To bring life, the infatuation
I’m only a figment of your imagination
When I talk, it’s no exaggeration
You won’t find another dude quite like me
(Uh, uh) Me and my everything crew
Everything’s big, everything’s new
Drinks on me, so what you wanna do?
Chill right here and head bop to the groove
Yeah, and it's VI for life
So if you want, we can fly to the VI tonight
Saint Thomas and Saint Croix, Saint John is nice
So girl, just let me know which one you like
(Uh) My plans now to live it up this year
That’s why I shine from my neck to my wristwear
We off, up in the party like we live here
Lights on, everybody’s gone, but we still here, yeah

I guess this is goodbye, Goodnight and Goodluck
I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elavated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo'
Converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight by
Six twoand they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh
I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, niggaSummer's mine
I swear I said about a hundred times, I'm gonna need it back
I wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you
I'm getting money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spending time just taking care of me right now
I'm getting money just taking care of me, girl
Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now


Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

It's fuckin' losers like you that make me do what I do
Make me hate where I'm from, you as fake as they come
Everybody got guns, who the fuck gonna squeeze
Everybody got SARS, you ain't fucking with these
Why you wish to be ghetto, tell me what's it about
Why you tryna get in where I'm tryna get out
Why won't you just be yourself, why won't you tell us the truth
Like how you only load guns when you up in the booth
You ain't nothin' to shoot, you don't even exist
You just a fantasy, family as weak as it gets
And you ain't speakin' a bitch, cause I don't listen to chicks
I don't argue with broads, cause I'm really a pimp
But I will tell you this, as far as y'all are concerned
Pull out my Santa Claus, and make the holidays burn
You can call me the Grinch, cause y'all are nothing but Who's
Just another bunch of phony acts with nothing to prove


Now let the kids play like the rider's ride
We spendin' all day, these niggas idolize
They claim they want fame nigga so we decided
That we gon make 'em some stars until the drama dies
But they can go back to they holes where they mama lies
Or write more lies about they drugs, guns or homicide
Funny, claim the thug life that they abidin' by
But run up on 'em, then they turn into the silent type, they wanna compromise
My niggas, we ride or die
And roll with them bitches that got they body right
These niggas ain't built, ain't got the body type
Time to break a nigga's spirit like the amistad, tryna fool the audience
Feel the ambience
Stars in your presence, kings of the city are appalled by the peasants
Ain't gotta say names, we can all get a reference
Brains and the info from your broads in the west end
Masters, flowing staggers on bars
Nigga stay mad cause his swagger's on Mars
Y'all niggas ain't thinking we callng y'all tards
Claim you want war, okay, on guard


Ayo, hey you Mr. Rapper Guy
When you in the booth, tell me why you have to lie
Come on, spit the truth, all I hear is bang bang, hustle this, hustle that
But if you hustle crack, then where the money at?
No proof, Dr. Seuss, storytellin' when he rhyme, like
Once upon a time I was really on the grind
There's another lie, couldn't out-hustle me
Hatin' when it come to D, I can take you're starting 5
I'm only goin' at generic rap niggas that
Rap about ki's but couldn't show me 10 G's
And these nigga' dry snitching on they tees
Standing out, like a sore thumb to the D's
How the fuck you little niggas didn't stay in your lane
Man you offered me a truce and I took it
Now I hear this bullshit so how the fuck am I to overlook it?
If this little nigga survive then it gotta be God
How the fuck are you a hustla with your factory job ?
And I dont get it, nigga I'm a fucking diabetic
And I don't usually eat y'all sweet niggas
Evertime I see y'all retard niggas y'all bitch out
Waddup Roxx? now we cool? then you dip out
Talkin' all that bang bang shit, pull a clip out
Sayin' you a blood, next week you prolly crip out
I'm saying, we don't believe y'all niggas (nah)
G-35, x5 nah niggas (yeah)
This here is a public announcement for my niggas (yeah)
No more goodnight, good mornin', goodbye niggas


I don't appreciate niggas sayin' my name in they bullshit
It's like putting a knife against the lyrical full-clip
Do shit on my own, I never asked for help
If I was rapping like y'all I woulda killed myself
And naw this ain't beef, it's missing a few ingredients
Dog you ain't a general, stick to being obedient
Piggy back, that ain't something I had to do
Laughing at Drake? you shoulda seen how I was laughing at you
I don't beef over little shit, angry? A little bit
Little niggas get little recognition you little bitch
I don't do the little subliminals, I'm addressin' it
And if Littles wanna get in the middle then i'm suggesting it
They called you a bitch, were tryna act out
They challenge 'em to a fight and then they back out
So tell me how the fuck I can respect you cats
If you a gangsta, then what part of the game is that?


Hey yo Aristo, I'm lost, can you tell me whats goin' on in the streets?
How it feel to count dough while you palmin' the heat?
And yes I asked for a 16, you did your 16
I heard that weak shit and only wanted the beat (it's true)
But fuck the money and the cars that I drive to set
And fuck the women that's lying to all the guys they met
And fuck the features on my songs and the deals on the table
Or basically it's fuck everything that you strive to get
And it's the room of resolution, I'm finishing it in here
If I copy Budden's flow, you mimickin' his career
And the same money we hearin' you giving to charity
You need to be giving to Littles to give him some clarity (what up Littles)
Cause that's your homeboy I think he's owed that much
Tell him pressing 25 don't mean you sold that much
And Breana, I don't mean to alarm ya
But you need to get outside the car to shoot this video in Parma (Tony!)
You act like you hood and hood niggas'll harm ya
And this is not hatin' my nigga we call it karma
But yo Thug Life, show me where the hammer be
Yes I took an L on my own and they didn't damage me
You try to cover up your lies like a canopy
And tryna pull 17 year olds down in Bramalea (i know about it)
And we don't got it out for you
We just saying that don't nobody vouch for you
Nope, nobody thorough is willing to give a cosign (nobody)
And you don't even sell blow, you just blow time
You can't even get a factor grant
So stop rapping, go fix parts at a tractor plant (damn)
And listen here, Tetley Tea
You one of the seven dwarfs standing next to me
You probably snitchin' in court, then accept the plea
And I hear you paying these women and I sex for free (what up sweetheart)
But dog, how did this start, how we get to this part?
We all got niggas doing bids "Mr. Wishheart" (what up Cam)
It's not cool to use another nigga's as a threat tho'
I said you a bitch, I heard a seven man echo
You saying I hustle, my source for currency coke
They saying you never moving it and currently broke
And you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime
Just so you can have something to say in you rap lines
They say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school(i did)
Dog if I were you, I tell you what I would do
I would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you
Lose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through
Tell them not to call and that's even if they require you
Cause they the only people recording that wanna hire you (it's true)
With what I spend in a weekend I could aquire you
Some of them believe you got money you little liar you
But, I don't admire you, short niggas tell tall tales
Good riddance Aristo I just retired you!You've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You was still you before she ever came along
Get over it, get over it
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth


I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet me

[Hook] (x2)
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet meI wrote this verse sittin' in my new car
Sometimes where you headed is too far
It’s more about where you are
And I am, everywhere where that you wish you could be
Somebody, somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope

Pick, Michael Jackson to Jordan to Tyson to Myers
Too much dirty money when the colors

It ain’t rocket science just rockets
I sleep in pussy not pajamas, grindin'
I got this shit down to a science, I turn in my project, A minus
Whew, I ain’t crazy, I’m krazy and all of my niggas chaotic
Dressed in all black like they gothic
Music too loud to hear sirens, we pop, pop, pop up where you stay
Knock, knock, knock, anyone home?
Pop, pop, pop, pop then we outtie
I need a bitch like Naomito take off her clothes like Leilani for niggas that’s grindin’

Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas
Cause what’s the hottest shit on these corners?

I got a new vision for all my shit
I don’t know what to call that shit
I know, I’m selling all of my cars
I’m selling all of my watches
I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit
I’m a different breed with this shit
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch
And I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill in one room, you, you could ask anyone out here
Who running the game? And they’ll tell you the truth
Man, they'll tell you
Oh look, they fuck with me now
I think they’re hearin' me now
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka that’s grindin'




(Grindin’, grindin’) Perfect timing
(Grindin’, grindin’)
(Grindin’, grindin’)
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Then peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space
Believe that


Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out,they flew out

Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I’m grindin’


She says "kiss me like you miss me,fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic don’t I? I get it poppin’ don’t I?
I’ll end up stopping won’t I? And by the time I end up stopping
You’ll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don’t lie
She’s losing it right now,cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now


I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone


Hotel to hotel, girl - I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo shit - I put you back in your place
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now

I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they saying I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gonna make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it, please don't do it
Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it

I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they miss the old Drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like "why I gotta be all that?" but still I can't deny the fact
That it's true, listening to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like "All My Children"
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gonna hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about finding yourself and how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family and struggle and it taking forever
About hearts that you’ve broken and ties that you’ve severed
No doubt in my mind, that’ll make them feel betterYea, Ha! Ok well
I suppose it's safe to say,this is the end for you
And the beginning for me


I'm a real nigga, nothing artificial

I be yelling out:
Money over everything
Money on my mind
Tell them I apologize
It happened over time, they knowBottles of whiskey, shout out to Fifty
And Jaekwon 'cuz after nine shots I'm feeling tipsy
I put on for my city, on for my city
So many meetings that my schedule is hella busy
Ah, I swear these women steady feeling it
Supermodels asking what the dealy is
I really is a superhero, Lois Lane,older women know my name
But 40 got me feeling so ashamed cuz I be dicking 'em, all
I swear these break lights are broke or something
That's why I know your older cousin
So when you're old and fussing
Ain't no reason I can't say I seen it coming
'Cuz when you're buzzing hating all of a sudden becomes a custom
Ah,I keep a couple bad women with me
The kind that don't mind splitting three O's like Griffey
Oh, I swear I'm feeling so spiritual
It's Einstein and I ain't even spit original
But they know




I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind
Tell 'em I apologized, happened over time, they knowAll the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'


She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment


Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "you don't how good it is to be you cause you're him"
And I say "well, goddamn"


Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone

Hey there, pretty girl
You know, exactly what you got
And I don't, blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the lights so bright
And the money so right
And it's comin in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in


Houstatlantavegas(ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes,"Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh


She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows, there's more to life
And she's scared, of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of




We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin,all-star weekend
One hotel room, and all y'all sleepin'
Housekeeping knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied wit a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin right, all season
But you always with me, on the night y'all leavin'
Ass low, ass low, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight is prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh... because I never had you
Although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo
Your name on my heart
I swear, I start, to think, that I'm going crazy

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you, shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam, I drove in the snow for you?
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl


My heart belongs to you


Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then


All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where,tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go,told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she pregnant
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit? Are you high right now? Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright


So much for being optimistic,they say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple,keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew,bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercialbut we still met later that night
After my session, she came over,I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn,she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

I swear to you every time I sees her, I seizure
Keep running through my mind, jog my memories; amnesia
Touch ya, tease ya, nervous?don't freeze up
She let me take control, I run my woman like a Visa
She always run back to me saying he's a
Dog off the leash, he got this other girl Alicia
She tell me she's in hell, I tell her take a breather
I'm nothing like your man, but I can't love you neither
It's wifey over bitches,but money's over her
Cause money's under nothing,my life is such a blur
It's not the way it has to go, it' just what I prefer
And anyYoung Money nigga I know would concur
Weezy talk to 'em!


And she wants me, she wants me, (yeah...)
And I want her too, yeah! I want her too


I'm talkin' 'bout shawty got something about her
Shawty got this thing about her
Shawty got that thing that make you wannna wrap a ring around her
Wanna rap and sing about her
So thats what I does, shit that's what it was
They Rub my back in the tub it was me ???
Yeah, we all buddies
If ya shy come see me for ya comfortin'
I got a comfortable suite at the Comfort Inn
I tell her
I don't own a boat baby but I can float
And I don't own a plane but there's a mary jane and we can float
Your man ain't worrying about what's going on over here
You could get penalized the way you blowin' below the rear
Now this game like a analog I don't sweat cause it show how fake you are
She stressin', ya she testin' ya, she just tryin' to see what kinda level ya on
You don't make it bounce like a basketball, you ain't even get no ass at all
Now you sittin at the club trying to laugh it off, she done found her mid glam boy
You messin up, you messed up, wasn't easy to clean your Mess up
She found me and I blessed her, I applied to her pressure
She call me a professor, I went gave her her lecture
I bet she says I'm better, than her man was ever



Thank God for the first nigga started trapping
Thank God for the first nigga started rapping
Thank God for the first girl to start stripping
And I'mma have to keep it muhfucking real with 'em
I got a problem with these niggas
I got a problem with these bitches
Trigger finger keep itchin'
I pull it, I do it


Hang up on a bitch, call it crucified
Time to go to work, no suit and tie
Bumpin' Makaveli, I be trappin' out the telly
My nigga did a dime and he back already
Got that sack already, man we got them racks already
As far as your girl, I hit it from the back already
I tried to get a tan, but I'm black already
Your pockets on a diet, my pockets fat already
Three niggas with me, me myself and I
God don't like ugly, you should testify
My T-shirt come from Bergdorf
I make so much on a verse I take the third off
Bird call, swerve off
Bust a nut on her, tell her that's a load off
Shorty ass soft, like a Nerf ball
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all




Drank in my cup holder, hope this shit don't spill
Pull up in the new edition and that's word to Johnny Gill
How I come up with this shit and all these verses that I kill
I have no imagination, everything I do for real
Bitch I'm camouflage down put your camera phone down
If she got an ass and the girl a fan, it's going down
I'mma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it
Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it
In the bedroom forever that's what her roommate will tell you
Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you
He might call up Patricia, she 'bout to call up Melissa


Tell 'em come to the crib and do them both, double dribble
I'm colder than a hospital, she love the dick that I give her
Hit her from the front, back, side, twist her like cigarillos
I put the gun to the pillow, I don't want blood on my clothes
Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh, shoutout to all of my hoes
Tunechi...


That's just how my OG would sum it up
I been working all winter just to fuck the summer up
It's just me and 2 Chainz, but the chain's never tucked though
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga fuck y'all




Well, if you know like I know that pussy pop like pyro
And she know I'm a pothead,that pussy like a pothole
I’m colder than the snot nose,man all these hoes is my hoes
If she bougie fuck her once then leave her hanging, dry clothes
I just built a cemetery, niggas dying to get in
Niggas lying, they pretend
Don’t cross that line its paper thin
High as a star, make a wish
I’m a shark, I ate the fish
I got no heart, I hate that bitch


You hate that bitch, well I hate that bitch
Will jump a nigga like a chessboard
Do a drive by while you’re riding on your skateboard
They ain't even know it
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet
Then I take her to the crib
Man fuck that bitch right on the step
Put it in and take it back out, then I back out
Hair weave killer known to snatch the fucking track out
Put me in the game coach, I'm the antidote
Pull up, kick, throw and take the money and the dope
True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane and a boat
I am so cold I need a cover and a coat
Kick it at the mall, call it football
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all


Y'all ready? 1, 2, 3
Right now it's me time
A little time for myself, me time
Oh yeah, right now it's me time
Don't want no one else now, me time
Bitch please don't call my phone, don't call my phone
Said I wanna be left alone, be left alone
Please, please don't stop by my home
No, no cause I feel it's just matter of time
Till you people make me lose my mind
I'm 'bout to leave this world behind
Right now it's me time
You need to go kick rocks now
Me timeSmack it up, flip it down, weigh it up, break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who’s ya daddy now
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now she's my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I must've had too much to drink I’m in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you’ll ring the alarm
And everytime you give it to me it’s gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets you’re gon’ be my lucky charm



(Man, that boy so cold, give him a blanket in here)


I D-O, I D-O, I D-O oh oh
I, Vito, promise to treat this game, i-de-al
Honor the code, not bring drama to mama’s peephole
Life’s a bitch but she's the only love that I know -ow -ow
So la-a-dee, after the “I Do’s” lets do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot, lets grab us a pot, lets make a baby
Looking back, I don’t know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully,cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And til the task force roll
To hug her every corner til I get ash from the cold
Or until I’ve amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever
Your secret’s I treasure, for better or worse
You’ll always be my first love til death do us part
Pull a hearse up, my verse up





I do, I do, I do, I do
Unh, Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC Hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know I'm just a boy that a woman could make a man of
So make me one, I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when she's 81
Please don't give it all away, I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around, there more jaded that they become
But this one special, so I make sure my suit will fit
The one my daddy wore in June of '85,I'm too legit
I'm just tryna get her in the mood
And having her doing all the things she'd only do when she get married
So let's do this shit
Tell the reverend, all we missing is his blessing
Because before she popped the pussy, she need me to pop the question
So we exchanged vows, they clapped, we take a bow
And she'll be doing tricks for daddy, when we take it to the house...




Nothing's more attractive than a heavy praying woman
To a him when those and them been defecating on me (ughh)
Her would sense the heaven, and him when Andre omen
Baby I’m hell, save me, don’t bail
Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like like "love"
"Friend," "rock star" and "So and so’s a genius"
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooohh momma’s sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit ain't gon’ fall too far from tree
So if we ever woop the woop
I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil’ cocoon
And maybe 2030 our baby, she’ll be nerdy make the whole club swoon


She'll love books and cook and look just like you
And when she's done being young, she'll dress like you
We'll call her Love 22, she'll tote a 22, the laser version

(Uh)
Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know that I'm just a boy that a woman can make a man of
So make me one, I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when she's 81
Please don't give it all away
I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around the more jaded that they become
But this one's special
So I make sure that my suit'll fit
The one my daddy wore in June of 85
I'm too legit
I'm just trying to get her in the mood
And have her doing all the things she'd only do when she get married
So let's do this shit
Tell the reverend all we're missing is his blessing
Because before she pop the pussy she need me to pop the question
So we exchange vows
They clap, we take a bow
And she'll be doing tricks for daddy
When we take it to the house1.

Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We shoulda did this already
Said I gotta email today
Kinda thought that you, forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely


Baby
I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely

Take Me
To another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me
With no rules
Just like you, I get lonely
Hoo ooh hoh, hoo ooh hoh
Just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
Hoo ooh hoh
Just like you
I get lonely


Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
Cuz too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely too




Hoh ooh hoh
Hoh ooh hoh
Hoh ooh hoh
Just like you
I get lonely too
Hoh ooh hoh
Hoh ooh hoh
Hoh ooh hoh

I get money
I get paper
I get girls all different flavors
I buy gucci, I buy prada
I spend dolla after dolla(x2)


Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket of my pants
I still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records all you sing ghost
20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich while you stayin broke
Chillin even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through a Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch when you throw me high fives
They try to measure up but there is no one my size
Whatever 40 smoking about to lower my eyes
Beast mode on em, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement I take the flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off




I'm the rookie of the year (year)
About to get my dough on
I'm about to take off, baby you should hold on
But I ain't about to prolong
I'm ma keep it short and tell you whats about to go on
Bottle after bottle cos the money like so long
Baby... we about to put a show on
I'mma show off, like I'm supposed to
Yeah you can get lost, I don't know you


I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't picking up an' entertaining them at all
Got your girl face down banging on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm, hmm, hmmm
I cannot relate
Riding with some tags that I got from outta state
Riding with a swag that I got from outta space
Just show me who's the hottest I'mma knock em outta place
Call me homicide drizzy about to kill your ego
I'm about my green puffing goodie like I'm Cee-Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While a Houston stripper pole dance in a Z-ro
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And my g-pass is as valid as can be
I'm, I'm so fresh the stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while she smiling back at me




Louie too
Yeah, Alexander McQueen
Im so clean
Its KC and Drizzy
And its the remix remix
C.O.S.S.O.M
HeheYeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's just best to keep quiet
But uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion
You know what it is


Look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, Rose and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spitting that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it repping, I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyeing me all hard
And lying to they girls and driving the same cars
Sitting there wishing they problems became ours
Cause we have nothing in common since I done became star
I done became bigger swerving writing in my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doing them shows getting everyone nervous cause
Them hipsters going have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm going off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, called hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast you, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga no coaster
Burn bread everyday boy, no toaster
G and Tez got a cig but I'm no smoker
They jus handing chips to me nigga, no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runnith over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out I hope we can agree on
Making enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'm a do is free Weezy, go


And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm going to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fighting the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheese head, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch Departed
All that blood like the red sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recording,I'm jus C-4ing
My currency foreign
We are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face falling
Watch the game from the side, I'm play calling
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I, damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-y no homo I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say bout when your palm itch
I'm going get money, money I'm going get
Young Money in your tummy and we going shit
And get that toilet paper quick like when Bones spit
That's right bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, Fuck the world with a long dick
Motherfucker I'm me, yeah bitch I'm me
You niggas sweet like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'm a take off when I leap, bye
And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, head butt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shuffling the cards bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger jus screaming, motherfucker, do you hear her?
Drizzy Drake what the lick read
We make magic boy, Roy and SiegfriedYeah, I appreciate ya patience tonight

Whoo! Young Moula baby, yeahReach for that hand shake, got a hug

Bottles of the Ace got me with a lil' buzz
Up in VIP with all my thug niggas
You leaned over and said you want me

Girl, when the valet pull the Benz up

Girl, sit back, relax, hold up
Let me turn the radio on


Girl, when I get you to the crib

Put the code in the gate, pull up to the driveway

(Father, forgive me)

Girl, can we take it up stairs

It's a celebration clap, clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of Moscato
For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this

Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out

Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it

Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself

(Lil' Wayne verse 1)
Yeahh
Uh-Huh
Ummmm Uh-huh
Hello Motherfucker hey hi how you dering?
It's Weezy F Baby come to take a shit and urine
On these toilet bowl bitches
Pussy ass niggas
Stompin' on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
Bad to the brisle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The Feds trying to clip us
But we ain't even tripping

(Lil' Wayne chorus)
I'm goin' in(x4)
And I'ma go hard (x4)
Bitch I'm goin' in(x4)
And I'ma go hard (x4)

(Drake verse 2)
First off you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cuz I live in my workplace
I get you the business so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high

I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, I'm so Sci-Fi
And I don't sit still I keep it movin' like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't never met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hookshots
Cover me I'm going in and fuck it when the hook drops

(Lil' Wayne chorus)
I'm goin' in (x4)
And I'ma go hard (x4)
Bitch I'm goin' in (x4)
And I'ma go hard (x4)

(Truth verse 3)
Truth feelin' like freshman who already
Who already need a letter man, late night with ya girl?
Fuck a boy she spendin' out one more with a better man
No my money strech like I got rubber bands?
Nah, ain't gunna loose a bone in me baby
Number one to the top with a rocket like Grady
Bitch call me Truth others call her Old Lady
Barbra car her name she's a pussy you crazy?
Yeah I'm back next swing call me Tiger Woods
Fresh center Hollywood, young still in hood
Never left the hood

(Lil' Wayne chorus)
I'm goin' in (x4)
And I'ma go hard (x4)
Bitch I'm goin' in (x4)
And I'ma go hard (x4)Hello mothafucka, hey hi how ya durrn'?

On the toilet bowl bitches,pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle

Bitch named Crystal,let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even tripping


I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard


First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though: I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me I'm goin' in and bucking when the hook drop




Hold up, wait one motherfucking minute
It's the El Capitan,I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfucking meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'mma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room, Yea you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not, but she know she fucking winning
She said, "I seen it all", I said, "no you fucking didn't"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a 2-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs", I'm like "bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in,where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt end
And I'mma be a legend even when my life end
And I'mma be a legend even when this night ends
Yea I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothing like them
I'm goin' in!

The clock that you've been watching has been stoppin
He makes you wait, what kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me I promise my hands will say


They'll say
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarms
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Think about the last time I came through
I had something more than a gift for you
And I don't only fuck you like that on your birthday

Baby I just landed
Bout to get my bags and all I needs an address
And I'm on my way

Don't fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Cuz I'm on my way (2x)Uhh, I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say anything I don’t mean
Like "what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?"
But get it while you here, boy
Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit, hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!


All I care about is money an' the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and Imma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, I said "fuck it, I’m on one"


I’m burning purple flowers,it’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt,move the kids to the hills(Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya "everything is great"
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair


All I care about is money an' the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and Imma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, I said "fuck it, I’m on one"


I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say "cheese" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches Mazeltov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence
(Young mula baby, YMCMB)


All I care about is money an' the city that I'm from

I get 'em up
I get 'em up
I get 'em upI’m getting so throwed
I ain't work this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like, what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?


So I’m gon get it while I’m here, boy
'Cuz I might not get this opportunity next year, boy
Jeez, guys, I jump on the beat, I go dumb
You knee high and I be on my fee-fi-fo-fum
Was 'bout to put in work like T.I. old guns
But D-I-D-D-Y was on one
These weak-ass rappers come at me, I choke one
My daddy was a soldier, I’m G.I. Joe’s son
Or Jackson, I keep it so G, I’m Joe’s son
I’m top fivin’, you can come see why Los won
Best rapper alive, it ain't up for an option
Nobody’s close to me
I should be up for adoption
I mean, one cell of my brain got Playstation capacity
I’m so outta this world, there're space stations harassing me
My flow’s so a trip that vacations are mad at me
And Einstein couldn’t get straight A’s in a class with me
I out last ‘em, out class and merk you
You scared to go in like you out past your curfew
Ahh shit, don’t talk shit then bullshit
My thoughts get on some Thor shit
It’s war, bitch
That’s how it is, so get up off your coward shit and battle me
I’m so charged up that I could probably shit a battery
You ain't seen nobody, like you skipped anatomy
I’m at your Adam's Apple, shatter atoms automatically
I’m on one, nigga, just a strong young nigga
In my zone, yeah, you fucking with the wrong one, nigga
Like a private Christmas party and you ain't get the message
So just because your present, don’t mean you got presence
And I’m so fucking gifted, you see me go light years
So its like you not here
Even though you right there
What I’ma bout to do to the summer done got the winter shook
Took a page from history and stuck it in the Guinness book
As a bookmark cause I’m book-smart
All my thoughts took action 'cuz my actions took thought
I hope the crown ain't safe, give you a creepy feeling
'Cuz you look up to me and hate me, I’m like a leaky ceiling
You see me kill 'em, how I pounce on these beats
And then I upstage rappers like balcony seats
See I’m in my whip and I got two sluts
Your girl gots hips that I got to touch
Slide it in her lips when I’m bout to nut
Keep your eye on your chick cause I got two nuts
And she on one!I’m getting so throwed
I ain’t went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like, “what’s up with your best friend?”
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what’s up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?

But get it while you here boy
‘Cause all that hype don’t feel the same
Next year boy
Yeah, and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin’ off you ‘cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me
And 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I’m just
Feeling like the throne is for the taking
(Watch me take it)


All I care about is money and the city
That I’m from
I’ma sip until I feel it, I’ma smoke it ‘til it’s done

Excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older somebody

Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten, I'mma get that shit

‘Cause I’m on one
I said fuck it, I’m on one



Listen
I saidI’m on one, but I ain’t Washington
These niggas kno what time it is, so go ahead &amp; clock ‘em in
I recognize I’m unsigned, &amp; still in I’m tha hottest 10
U talkin’ ‘bout Adidas, what’s tha deal with u in moccasins?
What’s up with it? My flow is colder than an ICEE
Sick &amp; tired of everybody tryna tell me what I “might be”
I’m a shootin’ star, but yet I’m makin’ all tha wishes tho
If there’s a better place, somebody tell me, when I get to go?
And flip it like reciprocals?
‘Cause I’m a MajorMove, they jus a smaller push
I try to give ‘em food for thought, then turn around &amp; call it kush
I’m in it ‘cause it’s art, tha money’s really jus a benefit
They say I’m something new, I contradict and say I “been a hit”
It’s like a ghetto “Genesis”
And I don’t need tha money, it’s tha fact that it’s enticing
What’s tha good of havin’ cake, when you’re aware you’re missing icing?
So I’m hoping that it pays off, no more layaway
Dad, watch your “son shine”, &amp; rain, rain, stay away
&amp; I can see tha facade, don’t try to flatter me
U kno I’m what tha game needs, nigga, call me batteries

I can’t feel you baby cause I romantically numb
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come
There’s nothing under God's sun that I haven’t done
I got a lot of problems, getting pussy just isn’t one
Girls are like buses every 15 min they run
Now they like potato chips I just can’t have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I don’t like your friends in my business
And I feel like you don’t deserve a visit
Cause you ain’t in the kitchen when you want a whipping



Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you



Uh, ok I’m all about it, all for it
I’m all star team Jordan, small forward
I’m never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so I’m shooting if I draw for it
Pow, Pow, fuck is up, naw man I’m in this ho
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I’m in it for
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me
Wondering if I’m the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna fuck you, niggas gotta wanna be you
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just don’t believe you





Ain’t that your girl
Ain’t that your money
Ain’t you the same nigga that say she want you that you funny
Ain’t you a gangsta, yeah funny
You gave em funny, gave you to you, fucking dummy
Classic line, bitches run like buses
Gucci say niggas asking why, why you with my girl
She let me get it nigga
She ain’t stupid, go turn up your radio
I’m the next young Lionel Richie
I gives a fuck about doing a fucking cameo
We don’ love em, we don’ love em, we don’ love em, NO!
They just love us, they just love us, cos we stack them O’s
Cos we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
Thats gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don’t go
Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline
I'm tryna get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wondering what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do something to me
Cause girl I caught the vibe like you threw something to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollering, who was that?
Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout do with that?
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine


Uh, baby you winter time cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm joking, I mean that thing is poking
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking
I got bath water that you can soak in,things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, well lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning
I roll over and ask if




Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wears
Therefore, you shouldn't judge a nigga off of the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here
Just say you're scared if you're scared but if you through frontin' we can do somethin'
And you know just what Im talkin' about, tomorrow you'll be callin' out
Cause tonight we getting right into the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warning

Shawty you Autumn-time cool
But they don't see your beauty, fuck all them blind fools
Body so mean that it's borderline cruel
Work 8 to 3, then from 4 to 9 school
Dominican girl who knows more than Mangu
She say lets stay in the room and order Dom Cruz
It sounds like a plan
Cause girl once I got you by your limbs
That guy who spot you at the gym can't put it down like I can
I wanna take you places further than where your feet walk
Why scream when your voice is better for sweet talk
A little accent, cute ass lisp
First a toast is said then a flute glass kiss
I like it when you whip yo hair, but thats Willow fault
I speak body language, fuck pillow talk
We can wake up ’round noon on a Saturday
And make a fuckin movie, now thats a matinee
But on the weekdays I wanna be yo’ wake up call

Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Sun risin’ while you yawning

Uh, baby you winter time cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm trying to make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show

You left me stranded in the morning
It was so moving
So
Something so precious  with the lips like a soft pillow
Straight to the touch
You kept me hustling all night , oh
It was something the wettest that I ever really flowed into
It was oozing ziggling don't be giggling
So hard on it you don't want to really want to damage
The package that came with the short time paradise
That lasted for something more then they really
Want to be calling the medicament
I gave you something right you
You want just like the maid
That all that matters
But I don't really want to speak on that now do we
And I hit like these when I did it in the morning

Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Sun risin’ while you yawning
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?

Baby this your morning

Property owner
All exclamations

My Aston Martin
The sex was trapped in
I didn't get a chance to take her to dinner

Even in her 2 seater I had to pin her
Then got on the fly
Do you remember
Cause I do I do
Will there be a round 2
Question mark
Damn I should have missed my flight my flight
He would only be right on right in
To cook you breakfast bacon eggs and toast
Dont forget the ring

Can I heat it while its storming, storming
While the weathers transforming-forming
Can I heat it in the morning, morning
Can I
Can I heat it in the morning, morning
While the weathers transforming-forming
Can I heat it while its storming, storming
Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Sun risin’ while you yawningYo, what's going on? This is Drake

Clean in this bitch I'm feelin' myself goddamn a nigga rich
And every time I touch it guaranteed to be hit
And when them checks come guaranteed to be a split
I'm flyer then an invitation
Like I'm the information
Toronto's been waiting and I'm glad ya'll been waiting patient
But I'm here now these niggas is old news
I mix cocaine powder with the pro tools
(Whip it)Yeah crack that's just how I double back
Europeako jeans bleeding on them white air max
And these niggas keep asking mewhen you gon' drop
Why the fuck you keep harassing me when's that gon' stop
I guess its when my albums selling in the stores
And they sayin' damn I use to know the boy
Now I barely see em
And the little kids wanna be him
He a star now look up you'll probably see him
Hook
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings

Nigga I'm Still doin my thing

I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing

Fly as I wanna be kush in the air I get high as I wanna be
S 550 navigatin' where I gonna be
P.A.G. mother fucker don't forget the E
Rep T dot till they bury me
Automare the wrist red diamonds in the necklace
Been getting' checks while you rappers stay checkless
Real street nigga feel free to do a checklist
They don't really make em like me
Had to give you a second to breathe
Nigga ballin' still a hobby and I do that with ease
I'm bout to catch pneumonia because my neck stay freeze
I'm in the west indies
A 100 grand on a cheap white tee
I'm the man in my city they demand at me
Nigga I rep for my city like a football team
I'm fly like the New York Jets be
In a G5 two nines on me like Wayne GretzkyEmotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say, it's been a pleasure

Reppin' till my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do
I'd like to say, it's been a pleasure

Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure

You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this

(singing)
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gonna let some money go
For theH-Town


Set up the occasion
I’m up in the placeand
If amazing was a young bitch
I'd be going to jail cause I'm fucking amazing
What's up for the taking
I’m ready and I'm willing, why the fuck are we waiting
Yeah, and baby you should bring your best friend
Then you should persuade her to let me get some sex in
Don't get offended, baby, that's just a suggestion
Really we can do it however..you..like
I’m probably in your hotel tonight
Whatever floor that me and 40 staying on is smelling riiight
Yeah, just know we grinding till it’s light out
Show up in your city, turn that motherfucker right out
Yeah, tell me who controls kings
I don’t follow rules, stupid old things
I’m riding through the city in the coupe with those wings
My team deserves some motherfucking Super Bowl rings
Oh yeah, and I know we gon' get it
Me and Jeezy bout whatever, shorty, holla if you with it
Even though I want it to this shit don’t last forever
But better late than never, honestly I’d like to say it's been a pleasure

Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this
They say that you never really know
What you got 'til it's gone and can't touch it (touch it *echoes*)
If it look too good to be true, you can't trust it(trust it *echoes*)
If you never had it (*echo* had it) then you can never miss it(miss it *echoes*)
But looks can be deceivin, so don't you get it twisted (twisted *echoes*)
Walked a lot of miles in these old school J's (J's *echoes*)
Thought of many ways, lookin at back in the days (days *echoes*)
Like how to climb from in between a rock, and a hard place
How to keep your cool when you're dealin with a hard case (with a hard case *echoes*)
And how to duck, when the judge throw the book at you (the book at you *echoes*)
And it's a two-sided mirror that you're lookin through (you're lookin through *echoes*)
The phone receiver's in your hand starin at your child (child *echoes*)
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile (smile *echoes*)
See that's how real life is and how it can be (can be *echoes*)
And how it's deeper then just comin down candy (candy *echoes*)
So I'm just tryin to play the cards that they hand me
For those that overstood me, understand me
It's been a pleasure




I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
I'll just say it's been a pleasure [*echoes*]You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?


I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine
So in other words nigga, do your thing


Mind in one place heart in another
Please pardon my brother,he’s just angry at you niggas
Who dont have your heart in your rap shitand got too fuckin comfy
Cause we still fuckin hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin faded, aww yeah I'm fuckin faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aww yeah I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow,8 months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later,I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out


Stop playin, I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, shanaynay, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish, you would bitch
Brand new pussy,pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock 40′s, nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, I'mma need some fuckin goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real, ho
Lil Weezy-ana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I ain't workin with a full deck but I deal ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfucking field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that "how-much-you-love-your-lady" money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date nigga
I'm a grown ass blood, stop playin with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’
I think you pussy cat, ha, hello kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay 'em down, tempur-pedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think it's cleavage
Its Young Money, yeah, tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meeting
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop pop potato saladI swear I ain't lyin' like this is my cubs
This is my tub and I'm dirtier than the summer, bitch
Weezy F. Baby, always lookin' like I done some shit
You ain't on nothin' bitch, better know who you fuckin' with
Try to fuck me, I'll kill you and who you comin' with
No homo, T, I had to go stupid
I'm on them high heels and I am no Bootsy
Collins Avenue,ridin' with the Phantom roof gone
Or the Maybach two-tone,and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24's boy, what are you on?
I'm richer than a bitch without the grey poupon
Yeah, I'm talkin' out of my head
I make a blue-eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a blood muthafucka, a blood muthafucka
Forever like E-T-C, period muthafucka




I'm so unsigned, it would blow ones mind
Cause to every single record, I am so unkind
There are no holds barred, there is no love lost
Nigga, this that crack and you know drugs cost
So P-A-Y-U-P
I don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me
Never L-I-E, I got everything I tell 'em I got
This young nigga showboat like I'm sellin' a yacht
Ya heard me?
Who else tryna smoke? Yeah, nigga, me too
Cause take my mind off the preasure is what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a ski-doo
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down ho, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm goin' in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that: 10-4




Put on my OJ gloves and go and kill this shit
Make a plumber throw his plunger like, "I can't deal with this shit"
They say I'm throwed off, I stay on pitch
The flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch I'm back on my shit like a fly
Since you wan' be fly, throw you off the roof, fly
Like Pookie,take a dookie on the rapper loose leaf
And throw his trash ass through the window like Mookie
To a shark you just sushi
You ain't hard, you're coochie,Wally Oochie
Soft as newborn booty
Said I'm movin' slow, I'm just thinkin' fast
Look back, I ain't behind you, I'm 'bout to lap your ass
And nigga I don't rest, I'm up 'til my time's up
I been a tec chef, all my beef prime cut
This ain't punch lines, nigga your punch is lyin'
Cause the only punch you ever gave was Hawaiian

26 on my third GQ cover
Your new shit sound like you do covers
On all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they're winning
On some coach shit, 50Ms for a three month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'mma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga


But that’s… that’s where all this.. that’s where the feeling is
That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all
We went through errythang..
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD…


Your money is just a little Barney’s Co Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best emcee
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I comedy central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga


Jodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
(Fuck you mean you ain’t got no condoms)
Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back


Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Feel naked cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you niggas is autistic, retarded
Started, hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours
No false gods,young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay,or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for twelve hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less to me
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's backY'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket on my pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records, are you saying ghost?
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, uhh, you staying broke
Chillin' even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch if you throw me high-fives
They try to measure up, but there is no my size
Whatever 40's smokin' 'bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement, I'm taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause it's about to go


I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang in Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest, I'mma knock him out his place
Call me homicide Drizzy, I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-pass is as valid as can be
I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while she's smiling back at me likeThis verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let 'em all go
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares
Couple texts
Couple dates
Couple "I think that we’re ready's"
Couple I think that we should we waits
Are we actin' like a couple
I’m just tryin' to get it straight
Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes
And then


Oh, you had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin'
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall


Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night
Every night was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident
I’m confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry
They need to get their sentencin'
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end



You were my, you were my, you were my girl
Shoulda made, shoulda made you my world
Shoulda done everything to make you happy, baby
Oh yeah


Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country

I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my

I love you through everything, I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?




These days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

[Outro: Gabriel Garzón Montanosample]
Rock me real slowly (x2)
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
Rock, rockLook I would have so many friends if I didn't have money, success, and accomplishments
I would have so many friends if I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
Man, I would have so many more friends if I lost my respect and my confidence
Cause I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition, and I see no response they get
Nobody's even hearing it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Detroit and disappear again
My circle got so small that its a period saying to myself

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
All I, all I, all I, ever ask is that you keep it 100
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Your better off realizing there's nothing you can do with me
All I ever ask is you keep it 8 more than 92 with me... 100It was, uh... it was alright. Shit's just crazy man. The whole energy out here is just changing, you know, it's just getting dark man, quick.It's like mans are on the road it feels like as if anybody is a target, you know, you just don't know where it's gonna come from, can't even gauge it man. It's like I go from that, trying to balance that to just balance my own sanity, drinking more, smoking more, you know staying up so late that it's early, like fuck.I'm not losing it though, you know, I'm just venting, I'm not like worried,it's already too late for these guys trust me, I'm just more worried about myself you know,I just gotta come home.



??: What's the day today?
??: October 2nd, 2008
??:I'mma take the same video, on October 2nd 2009and see if we can get in this thing without ID (?)









Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose


You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help


Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
And tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope that you don't get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell


I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purposeI done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama’s house we'd argue every month
N@#$a, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like “Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
N@#$a, I just think its funny how it goes
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show
And we started from the bottom now we here
—Drake, Started From the Bottom

When I was 20 years old, I was a computer science major at Columbia University and I needed a summer job. It was 1986 and I was barely aware of a place called Silicon Valley. In those days there was no “startup culture or entrepreneurship movement”. Most people were only recently becoming aware that computers existed and almost nobody knew where they came from. The startups themselves were quite different than today’s breed. Most of the important startups were computer companies like Sun Microsystems, Apollo Computer, Cyrdome, Compaq and Silicon Graphics. In 1986, there was no outsourced manufacturing and China was largely irrelevant to the technology industry. All the companies in those days had their own manufacturing—often in Silicon Valley—and were very large in terms of employees compared to today. Having more than 100 employees prior to shipping a product was not unusual.

Although there were important exceptions, very few 20-year-olds started companies in those days. I was not the exception—I just wanted a job. I wanted a job, but I knew absolutely nobody in technology or in Silicon Valley and there were no technology startups in New York. I had no idea how to get a job and then I got a break.

My father’s friend had just married Ed McCracken, the CEO ofSilicon Graphics. I had my father ask her if she would talk to Ed, which she did. Ed then passed me to his head of Administration, Ken Coleman. Eureka! I had made the proverbial “friend of a friend of friend” connection.

Ken agreed to meet with the son-of-a-friend-of-the-CEO’s-wife. After we met, he also agreed to take a chance on me as a summer intern.

Silicon Graphics was the Google of its day—the place where all the best engineers wanted to work. The company invented modern computer graphics and was building the coolest machines in the world. Prior to arriving, the only jobs that I’d held were paperboy, busboy, waiter, bellhop and valet attendant. Coming from those environments, I thought that I had died and gone to heaven. One day I’m washing dishes and the next day I’m helping debug the operating system that would run the graphics for Jurassic Park. In one connection, I’d gone from the outhouse to the penthouse. Everybody at Silicon Graphics seemed to be a genius, the products were incredible and I never wanted to leave work. I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get myself to Silicon Valley permanently.

Unfortunately, I had not been properly socialized for life inside a big corporation. As the son of a new left radical (who later completely switched sides), I was combat trained. If somebody said something that I didn’t agree with, I wouldn’t hesitate to attack them ruthlessly, call their ideas stupid or personally insult them. I couldn’t help it. It was how I was raised. It was like I was Huey P. Newton and everybody else was The Man. I am quite sure that I would have and should have been fired several times, but for some reason Ken Coleman took an interest in me and smoothed things over whenever I got myself into trouble. He was my personal guardian angel. He helped me to build my life and career doing what I loved.

Over the years, despite being about 100 times more important than me, Ken always found time to meet with me and give me pointers about how to be effective. Much of what you read on this blog originally came from Ken.

After we met, Ken’s career continued to accelerate. He eventually became the chief operating officer of Silicon Graphics. He is now chairman of Saama Technologies and on the board of City National Bank, United Online and Accelrys. And Ken continues to help people like me. He helps people figure out how to fit into the amazing, innovative, magical world known as Silicon Valley.

This fits in very well with how we think about Andreessen Horowitz. We help technical founders learn how to be CEOs, we help engineers find the right company and we help executives find the right match. So, it’s natural, obvious and awesome that today we announce thatKen Coleman is joining Andreessen Horowitz as a Special Advisor.What up, Lupe?
Chi-Town, check

My style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barely remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay, but check
It gets boring growing up in Memphis
Tryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would've done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
Luckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse
So every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
And plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
I'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
So now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
Playing chess, looking through some old school record ads
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Opened up the window and told me that the coast clear
And now I coast clear, take a deep breath
Feeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
This is each test life's ever given me
A-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a
Kick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
The kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
Think it's obvious that they need my soul
My cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
I said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"
She said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"

So I kick, push
Kick, push
Kick, push
Kick, push
Coast
Fast as the wheels replaced
I gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
So I kick, push
Kick, push
Kick, push
Kick, push
Coast
Peep the way I roll
Just a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
So I kick
Then push
And coastMy style is very Tennessee
Mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barely remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
But check it gets boring growing up in Memphis
Trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board it gets expensive
Luckly my aunt working as a nurse
So every time I needed something she just reach up in her purse
And plus she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I 'm staying in her house then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She say you need to be doing something other than skating
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
I ma let him know that your coming honey he's waiting
So now its me and old school
Chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Open up the window told me that the coast clear
Now I coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
Homie this is Recess east test
Life's ever given me a plusgraded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes I'm literly Landel Lewis with a kick and a snare
Kick flip in the air
The kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here
Breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
Cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
I say aunty this is a safe career
She said Drake I told you there's no skating here




Before he knew he had a crew
That wasn't no punk
And they spitfire shirts
And SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
Any escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy
They needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds
The world was theirs
Uh, and their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, "There's no skating here"

Look I let the beat bang I don't claim colors
Honestly the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winterbut when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi coast
Couple days on the beach then it's adios
Just look at what I done alone
You will swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
We been busy like some bees no honeycomb
And you could prolly feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I'll never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs...drizzy


Uh, I'm tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a muhfuckin' killa, killa, killa, killa
Listen, look before rap my last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success it look like right now
What was once gray skies is now white clouds
And I did with the ones that ya'll said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps and you'll see what I'm 'bout
I keep my money coming in and never going out
Chuck taylors on the pavement with the blamma's out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops buck you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped 'em out
I go for mine like it's overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over shined
Been fucked bitches I been on my grind
Cause on a mission your worst enemy is idle time... hussle

I’m still awake, getting money while the sun is up
And they keep saying how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie star doesn’t put the numbers up
Man, hate is so passé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day
Nigga and it’s just me and my money
Ya don’t even get to play when ya’ll leading by 20
Yeah I infiltrated the game
Iwas hesitant at first and fear what it would change
Now I’m high off the success and faded off of the fame
And still managed to keep all of my opinions the same
I am so far gonebitch I'm outta here
Hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear
I want it all man,I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit
Shout out to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Yeah from the beginning to the end
Know I’m into making history not into making friends
Muthafuckaaaa…We gotta sell these bitches the dream, my nigga
Niggas like Walt Disney around this bitch


You're in the presence of the real
Can't fathom where I'm at, baby,pop another pill
In a whole 'nother realm
If you want to make a movie let me know
It's a whole another film
I suggest you get your dress for the Golden Globes
What you know about Tim
Top down, the Aventador, 4 AM
On the sunset strip
Trying to get high at the sunset, baby don't trip
Hollywood lights, Miami nights
I'm on a motherfucking binge
Just might go and buy a Benz
Or trade a car for your friends
Oh yeah, we playing with them M's


Ridin' down Collins with my entourage following
Just left SoHoheaded to the Go-Go
Lap dance for the girls
Let her put her hands on the curves
You ain't about that life, you scurred
Ah, baby, you scurred like skrrt to the crib
What you know about the kid
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing


I just got back home, 40 days on vacation
No one killing the game, shit is all for the taking
What the fuck did I stutter?Am I being mistaken?
I'm a s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-star in the makin'
Who you said was the man? What the fuck is a deal
Really do it the best, I'm DJ Khaled for real
Got my thumb on the pulse, got impeccable timin'
If they forgot about my worth, I got a check to remind 'em
Got some things on the wrist, Cartier with the diamonds
If this was 10 years ago nigga would've went diamond
I been singing and rapping I make a killin' in both
If i had to choose a Jackson man I'm feelin' like Bo
Fresh down to the socks, team look like the Raiders
I don't take this shit for granted, I'd like to thank my creator
I'm coming b-b-b-b-b-b-b-back on you haters
I'm 'bout to put this bitch on her back and get back to you later
Man, whats up




Imagine straight from work to the plane, ain't no baggage claim
Don't need to change your clothes, girl, or your last name
Motherfuckers want to act like I'mma call
If you want to be a star, girl you need a co-star
Got some bitches we can call up, babe
Now they want to know who you are and how you got there
Girl, I can try to care, oh, get you out of here
You and all this gold on me
On a plane going home, not as you want
What you motherfuckers know about me?Yeah, this that Oliver, 40, Niko shit man
15 Fort York shit ya know
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?

On my way, money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'on't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'mma write my wrongs

You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

Uh, when did you get like this?
Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, this just ain't my style
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile, for me


Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us


When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before?
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store


Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us


Look, Leave me, leave me, I can't fuckin stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we 'pposed to be together 'til the world end
But, I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call
You just tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that... do that... do that
Yeah


I've been up for four days, getting money both ways
Dirty and clean,I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinking how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me "Nobody's working as hard as you"
And even though I laugh it off man, it's probably true
Cause while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous, prom night nigga
I grow tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
But I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stunting hard in his yellow goose
And I'm a motherfucking missed target
But a target none the less and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talking to themselves Hov, hands free
And I'm just filling up this daily planner
Getting busy cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talking in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammer
That's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwing you
Just know that she gonna tell another nigga when she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me


Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down, we gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'm a make it go


Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls, I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flowing, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight cause the satellite was crispy
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
Ain't got a scar yet
Cause you fucking around with me and my dogs is far fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, trying to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meet, watch for the traitors
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too, all I got is this money, this'll do

Only videos  connect me to Phamous people
And had dreams that one day I'll be these people
Passion so great, equate that to Kanye's Ego
Let me take a break,Hi fam I miss you people
From humble beginnings like Christ in a manger
We looking out to being everywhere  Power Ranger
Just like Guinness, greatness been my nature
Call this my Pep Talk but I'm no Guardiola
Ha!
If only wishes were horses, I'll  be riding on that POLO like Ralph Lauren
Then I just flourish, move from dawn to morning
Always fly, that nigga Pope is so flawless
I Ball like J, and I ain't talking Jordan
Sing my heritage something like Morgan
Flow on keys, make you feel it in your organs
Bars bigger than the arms of Hulk, Hogan
But I'll be waiting for my moment
Show love to my thugs and single women
Even if all you see around is bad omen
Keep pushing till you see the light up, fulfilment
What you waiting dude, see what we came through?
'Member we been on this move, since our A moon
Now you believe me if I say dreams do come true
Used to love Rumor, Kendrick, Lu(pe) and Nas too
Now see weytin this guy do
Making critics go sick with the attitude
I should be in Yeezy's clique cos I'm so GOOD
Yo Drizzy hook me up, beat is so full soulful


Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up (LIGHT UP!)
Wait until the sun goes down, we gon' make this
Bitch light up (LIGHT UP!)
Even when the sun goes down I'm a make it go


(Aah!)Who would've thought that  from the background
I'll be the same person now leading in the front-line
Michael Jackson vision though I never back-slide
Now e be like say I get chaw Goodluck pass Jonathan
So Be4 we shine, word to Kojo-Cue
Have dreams of doing things they say that you can't do
Me and my success book an appointment, No rendezvous
I See Notorious in my mirror, get that Bigger view
Let's Roll-on charley, now that's a Sure Thing
Now my success is guaranteed like its a LeBron Ring
Money in my youth is like Y(fm) so I'm yearning (for more)
Lessons in our lives are like stripes that we earning (Common)
If you dey hustle for real show your light up
Just say, I can be the answer
Not a Nissan, but Christ a  Pathfinder
And be ever-ready to beat the odds, u a Punter (panther)
Money makers, now see what money made us
Partying every night, now I look kinda faded
Drinks up in the air, let's toast to these haters
Imma Tell u like Drake told me, bye TAKE CARE!!!

Hate is temporary
Love is necessary
I went from eating pussy to eating commissary
Damn, I am the sickest, I need therapy
You can buy the answers but you can’t afford to question me
First off I don’t need you second guessing me
Jail is like third base: I’m coming home eventually
Still got shooters like hot tubs
Man I'm anemic: still got blood
I’m in my cell reading fan mail
Wish I was in Amsterdam sipping Amstel
Thinking bout all of that pussy I can’t smell
Man they did me wrong; I feel like Nelson Mandel’
I shine too hard my lamp fell
My name still ringing: Alexander Graham Bell
I know you met damn, cause you know damn well
That I still got you open, open like a clam shell
Yeah, still fly on my hawk shit
My conversation stinks cause I talk shit
Stay in your lane you’re on that double-park shit
We eating at the top, get a spoon and a forklift
I got rap wrapped up like a gift
I’d be sober if gift was a fifth
I’m feeling like Elvis – jailhouse rock
I’m not 2Pac, I’m the New Pac
Behind bars but the bars don’t stop recording over the phone
I hope the call don’t drop
Drizzy got the ball and I know the ball won’t drop
And I pray none of my kids never wanna be cops
Young Money get ‘em, Young Money got ‘em
The boss got his feet up, vacation on an island
Yeah and tell your girls send the kite up
And even if you don’t smoke motherfucker you gon’ have to light upHands down
I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut
It's you I'm thinkin' of


But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
Cause you don't know, who I was before you
And basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah...
Ohhh-ohh-ohhh
But you're on my mind
But maybe in time, in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm a...


A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you

I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I..


I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff, cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you'd say it
You'd mean it, I would let you do it
It was you and I and not only..


I hope they never find out...
What they already know, know
As soon as it's official..
We'll have to let it go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson

The pressure's on
Both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh, well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably a...

Getting sober for a day
Got me feeling too low
They tryna make me slow down
Tryna tell me how to live
I'm about to lose control
Well they can watch me fuck it up all in one night
I'm in my city in the summer
Camo'd out, leather booted
Kissing bitches in the club
They wanna threesome, then some
Spend whatever come in, fuck an income
Me and my niggas we ain't never going broke
And you, have to, do it all
Just to know where it gets you
Living dreams we can never afford
Now we sitting in the back saying


This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for


This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake dawg,this the shit you need God for
How long do you think it's gon' take for y'all to fall
That's a serious question because I seriously question all of y'all
Been touring the world man, I've done spent racks in all the malls
And they know my story, flaws and all
I still got plaques hanging wall to wall dawg
She just offered a strip tease, but she don't look like Demi Moore
Hips all on 45, waist all on 24
And it's all love in the city,still scream XO, when that Henny pour
But I'm that boy, not just any boy, what the fuck you think that I'm in it for
Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince, but they know I'm king
Chubbs might hold that thing, if he get caught, he'll be home by spring
Things I shouldn't share, I mean for the sake of my career
I'm not trynna stunt, I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear
This the shit that I live for with the people I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake dawg,this the shit you need God for
This that shit we really gotta talk about in person
There's some shit I need to work on, but I know you see me working
Nigga, champagne...

Reporting live from the gutter
I'll buy these motherfuckers talking big money shit bitch
Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talking 10 mill just to get an asset
I know them tears still falling down on my last bitch
This money made me hungry I'm a savage
I've seen the stars lining up you couldn't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ah
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ah
Cuban links hanging on my wrist I was on welfare
Wake up in the house I look up, I see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see hell everywhere,I get mail everywhere
Walked inside the booth and came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean I ain't started drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean my nigga still there
Just imagine you was livin' lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pools sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that will keep it real yeah
Got a lot of pretty bitches I just paid their bills now
Money make her feel good but does she make me feel good
Known for getting that guala out in Europe but I'm still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a model, fuck her like I'm on my last damn dollar


Reporting live from the gutter, I will buy this motherfucker
It's not even a discussion
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gonna end up dipping with me, yeah, yeah
And I got her tripping off of yay, yay
Pillow talking, dishing out on all y'all
In one ear and out the other
Shut your mouth and take what’s coming
Live from the gutter dog, yeah, yeah
She don't want pets but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dogs that go Karrueche with the chopsticks
And we gonna miss you
They don’t want no smoke, they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
But these the times we gotta live through
And I'm...


And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Uh, uh, fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it’s six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout to all my Asian girls, Dim Sum
Shots came I don’t know where they descend from
Probably some bad hoes, I’m 'bout to take your hemp from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only the real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I’m just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Don’t I got that shit the world, wanna hear again?
Don’t Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows just bore me, paint drying
I’m never tripping over anything that ain't mine
I’m hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It’s been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I didn't notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
And the kids wearing crowns over here and everything is alrightIt’s like ’09 in your basement and I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father – my one button, you push it
Now it's "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!"
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me,I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son -- man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it


Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done


It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
It still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib, you would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out, man
You deserve it



All we wanted was opportunity
(Just Blaze!) Lord knows!


It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffaand Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real
Places they say they've been, we actually going for real
I'm really killin' shit,fuck all the jiggy rapping
I'm going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up,it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real


You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal


I fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink
The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss,came to buy the bar
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star
Everyday them hammers bang,whipping yay like Anna Mae
I run the game but the ladies think I'm running game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate
Rozay and Drake,I'm getting cake, nothing short of greatWhy y'all trippin'
I'm just fine
12:45, 'bout that time
Been at it all week, time to unwind
Drink like tank, lose my mind
This shit crazy, way too packed
Rose baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind


I'm hearin' voices in my head, think I'm schizophrenic
I swear they sayin let's get it from another planet
Thirty-six a thousand times, I'm doin somersaults
Do it right and you can leave your whole summer off
I'm out my mind, yeah a nigga's seein' double y'all
Tell me what's the chance of Jizzle fuckin' both of y'all
She said long as we could do it with your ice on
If that's the case we might as well leave the lights on
I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand Swisha Sweets
In my black and orange Charger, call it trick or treat
It ain't nothin' to a boss, my goons got goons
House stupid dumb big, my rooms got rooms




Do I love these hoes ? Mmm, kinda sorta
I got 'em drinkin' Sangria like it's fuckin' water
Some Miami women, tan lines showin'
And they really 'bout whatever, shit is mind-blowin'
Fuck what they talk, do what I say
Bust it open girl and send it my way
You say you like it like that I think I like it too
Half a million in a week, it's only right I do
All seein eye, my eyes seen it all
I talk a lot of shit, I swear I mean it all
Yeah, one-oh-three
And both fingers to the haters try and front on me




Drop the top, no bra, got the tittes out
Mention my name and bring the whole city out
Doin what I do best, D-boy stuntin'
New car, old money, D-boy stuntin'
Step in cleaner than a newGlock-40
My nickname in the A, strapped up Shawty
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothpick
Line wrapped around the corner, boy too big
G-Code, black shades and my black chains
But if you wouldn't understand it's a black thang
You know we drink thatRos�until we black out
Wake up, drink some Moe' and pass back out




What's up nigga
Yo, yo, nigga 103
Yo, yo, nigga 103
Yo, yo, let's go
Let's goDamn, another 20 missed calls
I love her and I hate her
It's a funny twist y'all
Can't stand her it when she in town
But miss her when she gone
Truth be told
I'd rather be with her than alone
But fights break out
And neighbors call 5-0
Screamin you the most foul bitch I know!
Forever mine wherever I go
Sex pistols out (bang) die slow
Nah die slower than that
Just co-llapse all over my matt-ressss
Who shot cha that nigga ain't finished
So once again I find myself in it (click-clack)
Just let me take a minute
Round 2 is in the chamber
All you gotta do is spin it
Aim for the heart
Battle of the sexes
All's fair love and war casualties expectedI'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'mma ball til the day I fall

Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me


Uh, pussy ass nigga stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire and these hoes love me like Satan, man
Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick, she's on a strict diet,that's my baby
With no makeup she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better then Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said "Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit,that's that filet mignon
She said "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said "Baby just make me cum
Then don't make a sound"




Real nigga fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, maaaan!
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, $69.96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest to chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down, I'm arrestin' this bitch
All my bitches love me and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes names
But then I would be snitching
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges
Lil Tunechi!



[Verse 3: Lil Wayne] (x2)
I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches
And I be schooling them niggas
Pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hating
I'm getting ass or I'm skating
Bitch

I love my team, I'll die for them niggas
Hating ass niggas in my circle, had to cut em out
Gold digginass bitches, fuck em then it's fuck em all
Had my niggas locked down, so I'm screaming fuck the law
Strap on,clip bent,riding in the Cadillac
Jack boys looking at me, and they know I ain't having that
Let them niggas pump you up, Like you just had an asthma attack
I'll Hit You With That Rat-ta-tat, Bowww
We just like the Mafia, body ya
Break the Code of Silence,and we gon Illuminati ya
Pull up in that black thing, Phantom of the Opera
We be selling fish scales, just to make Tilapia
I be up all night,chasing down them Benjamins
You should see this money,all these pretty hoes I'm swimmin in
Walk onto the stage, singing "Not Afraid" by Eminem
Take me to the boss bitch, I don't deal with middle men


Im about whatever man, fuck what they talking about
Their opinions doesn't count, We the only thing that matters Ooowww
We do it how we do it, all up in my face man I hate to put you through it
I be up all night whole crew in here
And I don't really know if Ima lose this year
Man I love my team, man I love my team I'll die for them niggas Ooowww


If Omelly tell me fuck her, Ima fuck her
And if my nigga like I swear to God that I won't touch her
Cause loyalty is everything, them niggas is like my brothers
If you don't see me with them everyday, mostly likely I don't trust em, so fuck em
Ima North Side nigga,with a South Side attitude
Got the streets already, know I'm coming to take the avenues
Broke them niggas love, but when you get money they get mad at you
Like why Tip ain't sign you yet? Cause I ain't never ask em to, Ahhhhhhh
Just Look At My Wrist (Bling) You Look Like That and I Look Like This
Im looking Rozayish and You Looking Like Chris
Old played out ass nigga, hating on me broke bitch
It's whatever mane, fuck what they talking bout
Niggas diss me in they rap, see me and try to talk it out
I just look em in they eyes, ain't shit too talk about
Cause if we catch em without the crowd, we gon chop em out

So hard to breathe this air that we call love
Ain't nothin' worse than the hurt we receive in love
When you get hurt by the one you livin' for
Pain can make you wanna love no more


Lovin' you no more
I just I can't I just can’t be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just I can't I just can’t be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself


Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try


Uuh, tryin' not to over think
Only cause I’ve drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gone do
Since everythin' I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uhhhhh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby then we’ll be for sure

I'm tryna do it all, tonight
I got plans, I got a certainlust, for life
And as it stands, everything is going as right
As it can; they tryna shoot down my flight
Before it lands...before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin rich suppose to solve that
And these days women make offers
And who the hell am I to say (No, no, noooo)
My ex sendin' late night text
Cause she don't know how to let (go, go, goooooo-oh-hooo...)
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models standin in the cold
Ah yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all... in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see
Every time... that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Surburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh...and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux
I don't really give a fuck and we only gettin older
So what I tend to do is to think... of today... as the past
It's funny when you comin in first... but you hope... that you last
You just hope... that it last... {*echoes*}


I clutter all of my pain into a puddle of emotion
I just hope you know that you're the only thing to keep me focused
Mind full of thoughts drowned deep into the ocean
To your soul, I'm so devoted, I'm just too afraid to show it
As the pain builds up, all the tears drop down
And smear all the ink on every single paper that I wrote this
Causing me to throw away the script and let my soul spit
I just wish that you could see my soul and
From that very moment that I looked you in your eyes
I noticed life is but a dream and I am so very alive
I noticed that feelings I always bottled up inside
Were just results of me refusing just to swallow up my pride
And now it hurts much, I wish I could rewind
And get another chance to show you how I feel inside
Just one more time... before I disappear
And losing you forever has always been a distant fear
I felt that you were young, don't wanna grow out of your heart
And watching you grow every second's always been the hardest part
You were my sunshine, and now you're just a stranger
I didn't realize I loved you 'til everything changed up
And nothing stays the same but my love for you remains
And when my heart was broken, I just gave you the remains
You mended all the pieces and neither of us noticed
And now I'm sitting here figuring ways that I could show it
See then, I didn't know it, that it would be this
That it would get this tough, I really can't believe this
And you were always there, but I guess I had it figured
When it all came down, you were all that I remembered
And I remember vividly every single moment
You would ask me to rap and by the second time, you'd know it
I remember writing poems around the end of September when you saved one
Asked me for one, it took me forever for me to make one
That was just for you... and now I make this song
Actually showing you love should never take this long
And I don't really know what I was waiting for
I just regret I had to wait this long... damn
(And now you're taken... and everything is changing)


Throw your ones up in the air...
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up

Low-key Peter Parker flow
Tell her bring some Ace of Spades no sparklers though

See broads over niggas but business over broads
See businessequals money and money’s over all

Raised the bar, I set the standards
My yayo MC Hammer, that bitch just keep on dancing
Michael Jackson, let it moonwalk
Set it on the napkin, let it cool off

What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again
Soon as you get in


Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel, we'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel and don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care, don't over prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think know the way but, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to goSpending shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone, so they'll never know
But I might tell you one day, you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel anddon't worry 'bout doing your hair
Or what you should wear, this not a video shoot, I don't care
Don't over prepare
Gotta remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way, but just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you, j-just be ready to goNow baby, now baby you know just who I am
You heard that shit with Kurupt
Girl Im the fucking man
I know you got a dude but he don’t understand
I take you to an Island he can’t even buy you sand
I put it down right (down right)
Me I need a queen to wear that crown right
I can turn your long days into loud nights
Girl I flip it, turn it over, touch it make it sound like
When it come to pussy Im a connoisseur
I can fuck you till your a lot more than kinda sore
Girl Im a dog with a bone like a dinosaur
I make you scream, grind your teeth
Make you climb the walls
So fly you divide the law





I tell her, I tell her
We not just any guys
I bet they're broke for a reason, no need to empathize
I tell Patrone truths, I tell you Henny lies
And you believe em all
I can see em in your eyes

Take so long just to get to the point where you rich
And you there and its oh so funny
I stunt so they can see me
And therefore they should know
They call me Drizzy baby
Wanna see you make it go


I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise


I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, all I can say is
(I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you (3x)

Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you…


...B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’sPink Friday RecordsandOVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch

But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away

He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly Parton



Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you areLook, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background witcha asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
I ask you to have some patience
(you're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya are part of the speech coz


I'm from the city where people be gettin lazy
Litterin in the streets
And the club district is poppin like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers
Money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams
And dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events
Bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot
So girls'll give up the ass

And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
Daffy and bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane
And she back where she was
Right back on the bus
Its a shame cause now at his window
She throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch
You can see thats shes colder
Cuz he doesnt hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her
That he couldn't mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say




Now up north theres five artists deservin a listen
And I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through
Chances are that it ain't you
I singlehandedly carry out what you can't do
And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in &amp; the out [?]
Whenever I'm out in memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm andreena mill
Japan and brazil, the audience acreaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh


If you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background witcha asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
I ask you to have some patience
(you're worth so much more)
To my dudes in the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin cigars in the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya are part of the speech cozEstamos incendiendo el party aqui
Introduciendo llega Fito Blanko
Baby girl dime si estas ready
Esta noche te voy a dar mambo
(x2)

Si tu quiere mambo
Voy a darte mambo
(x4)


It’s Drizzy, baby
Alright why does this sugar love me?
I don’t even have a chain yet
You go on and guess
This homie tells me we’re on the same bet
Rico, T.J. doin’ half of it we are from the same set
They get Magic City money
They call that a rain check
I don’t make it rain, no
I don’t have the income
I just got enough for all these bottles that I drink from
You virgin to the Fresh Prince
No, I ain’t a king yet
The world is my playground
Don't fuck with my swing set
I run it, I swear I really run it
And everything I talk about
I swear I’ve really done it
Yeah, I smell good
And my car sit super low
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl


Si tu quiere mambo
Voy a darte mambo
(x4)

Estoy ready party killer
Voy a darte mas flow
Para darte mas flow, no sigue bregando
Quando el caso, now
Dile a Drake, pa' que sepas que esto no es relajo


Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall


Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig


I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shadesin a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I lived at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?
Cause I don’t waste time, can’t yo see a nigga lazy
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy’s fucking crazy




Y.M., bitch, everyday
Two times on Sunday
Spitta!
Check your blinkers, baby
Check your blinkers, baby
Cause, to me, look like you’ve been turning right all day, yeah

Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good.. you still working?
Tonight... right now? Did I go out? Yeah, I went out
I went.. I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit..wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious..


Cups of the Rosé,bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that I'mma call her anyway and say


Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around


(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me


Uh, cups of the XO,all my people been here
I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning, what you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much that I'mma call you anyway and say


Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around


(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me


I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them,I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on,"Well, I'm sorry"


(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me


Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no one heard that,I hope no one heard that
Cause if they did, we gonna be in some troubleI'd jump right in and fall asleep
Cause you are the death of me

Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling
Hands I was dealt when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when you're my type
And you're winning from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience, one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize That, and your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto, hit me on the cellular
Thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
Then he said that he was the same age as.. myself
And it didn't help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I'm breathing all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why, the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I diedCash rules everything around me(cake, cake)
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all


I wouldn't sell my soul for it all
The cash, the gold, the Rolex, the sex
The lust, the pleasure, the million dollar check
I wouldn't sell my soul for it all
Knowledge of the Kingdom but I'm stuck
So hard to move [?] off my hands I was trying to harm this fool
If you thought I'm upset I bond to this carnival
And alarm don't worry my struggles aren't hard to you
Why do I question God's love like it's so hard to prove
Know you only exist cause God thought of you
Now figure that, it's hard to do
Go and try can I promise you it's hard to do
Every mistake that we make it's still starting to
And I'm the one that did it, it's almost like I saw Tucson bleeding ruse
No justice that a song could do
But the moment He looked at me I saw the truth
Some of us just sell amount to put on some jewels
Pharmaceutical dreams of being rich
No one can lose, small pursue
Occupy, mind made for larger moves
I'm tryna live, I'mma follow ones for two


Cash rules everything around me(cake, cake)
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all(cake, cake)


These snakes always seem to be close to me
It seems that must treat the ones that mean the most to me
And when this Egyptian touches my chest I'm feeling so outta breath
My conscience won't let me rest
I'm exhausted
Me and Louis V., Jacob jewellery, [?] and we zoning from the purest keys
Technically a prince call me palmer trees
Simple rose ain't white linen it's south beach
Red carpet up but I keep a hood reach
Hood bleeding so I cleaned it with the good bleach
And every industry rapper we yell preach
They only spit truth right, *beep* please
Man we talk about the cake
Sierra mist with the jelly on the bass
Got a sweet tooth stir it up and then bake
Give you type two, cold body with the shakes
I ain't frontin' B
And you can never have enough of it
[?] or rich, equatorial or obelisk, have a certain lust for this
Talking Grandino
Grant got me blessing, Franklin off the ego
Room so free-o
Chains got me starring out the peep hole
Schizophrenic, keep it on the d-low
[?], don't tell them what we know
Money's the route of all evil, amigo
Cake it, cake it


I got the couple unmuted, I hid in my trunk
Hitting that coffin I'm housing it up
The strippers they throwing it up
God over money I'm burning it up
Every young rapper we change in the game
I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazing conversation
With this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
She could be good for me yeahh
That's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact she's right here with me
She's starin' in my face, somethin had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh


I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oooh
Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup....


On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away


Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay


Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup....


From 8 until late, I think ‘bout you
You own my nights I don’t know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should


Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay


I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to
Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should

I gotta pull up on you
You gon make me have to pull up on you
Don’t go ghost on me, I'mma go Thriller on you, I'mma just
I'mma let my hands do the talking when I see you baby girl
I miss feeling on you, I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you
I been about you and I’m still about you but
We ain't finished talking
I told you you don’t need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking
Cuz they don’t wanna see you happier than them and girl you swear they all
Your friends and there's been a problem
You the one they hate, just come with daddy
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
And you tell me that you’re done with that
And I believe it's true as long as you know who you belong to


But now im steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would of cared more
Thats my only feeling inside when ever I get a song done
Im scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now its like a shock to my pride
I dont care if she know
Cuz thats basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a misses


I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out, do you still live at your old house
Do you got somebody new in your life
Cuz I can't get you outta my mind


And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
I said "Tell me what's really going on?"
"Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happening?"
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfucking scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got 'em right?) Yeah I got 'em Bun
I love myself cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call the King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
Work something, twerk something, basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here getting naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere,trill everything
And Drake just stands for "Do Right And Kill Everything"
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it
And girl I'm fucking serious, I'm with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me onand your pants are mighty fitted
Ugh,damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rolling
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowing
Cause it's on


Yeah girl it's on
You knowwhat it is when I finally make it home
I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope you miss me a little when your gone


Ooh shit, motherfucker, goddamn
Kicking bitches out the condo like Pam
Getting money every day, I'm a groundhog
'bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ugh, that's nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan,I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lying I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lying in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it I ain't tripping, I know Drizzy gonna kill 'em
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim
Mama said if the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em
Real nigga talking, shut the fuck up, ho
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up, Zoe?
Weezy F Baby and the "F" is for "front door"
Cause that's where I bring it,Soo Woo if you banging motherfucker




Uh, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy

When we're done, this moment will be syndicated, I don't know-This night, just reminds me of -
Everything that they deprived me of (CHEA!)

It's big money popping baby boy
Ain't none of that lil biddy


Big Tymer on the loose
Got a bitch riding 5
And every time I pull up, you know I'm iced up
When I step up in the club I light the bitch up
Back on my saddle throwing purple out the truck
Candy paint, rally stripe, shining like us
Pearly white Maybach hatchback
Automatic straps, stash spots under the rack
Bitch, ready to spray that
Foreign grinds, hard times
Getting mines, you know: Uptown
Big time doing time
You know, Harley Davis baby
Cash money is who pay me so you pay me how it weigh, baby
Black gold, 100 mil off the floor
Never told now you know how it go bitch
One hundred, one hundred




You're now fucking with the most requested
The young nigga that everybody is so obsessed with
And black-on-black 62 float majestic
Me and Stunna in it, boy: I'm just so connected
Caught up in a popularity contest
I'm about to reach my dreams and I ain't even got my arms stretched
Thank Me Later: first week, I'm taking all bets
Because a million copies isn't really far-fetched
I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on til the flash stops
It's for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got em for a reason shorty, go ahead, bust it open
I keep a secret, baby: nothing's heard when nothing's spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star
Are all that fuels the conversations between y'all
And dogg that's funny; pay me what you owe me nigga
All cash money




Well it's that big body nigga and his big body car
Got a big body boppa with that million dollar jaw
She said: "daddy I like sushi, so give it to me raw!"
I pulled out my strap condom, looked down there and said "naw"
Cigar full of Kush you need prescriptions to access
Laying on the mattress with your favorite actress
My blunt was going out, I said "baby, pass the matches"
And let her top me off while I'm tapping off the ashes
Classic, but classless
You gassed up, but gasless
Unleaded, yeah. Bun said it, nigga get past it
Taking what you got, you should've passed it
You was moving slower that molasses
This time you were nasty
Give it up to him; it's a jack
Don't move! This is murder music, nigga
Don't disturb this room.2 trill Ent Cash Money and October's Own
We true playas down to the last chromosomeNow-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right)Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!


I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for freeee

And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me, homie


Money’s the reason my best friend got murdered
So with that and my amounts tryin to make it just to burn it
Milk the game, turn it to butter, look how I turned it
No chick shall get any of dis unless she earns it
Take that dick, put to your lips and insert it
Where the hell is self-respect go when them checks show?
You sleep with them anywhere, hell is your bed for?
You always on your back, what the hell is your legs for?
I know, walk that strip, get my grip
That new Benz’s comin out, put some 'umph' in your switch, trick
Plus I need rims, diamonds and gems
So get up, do the hand job, and some head for him
I got my mind on my money, and my money on your mind
I’ll blow your mind all over the money that’s on your mind
So keep my dough off your head, fuck with do on your head
Now you really got money on your mind, nigga!

I am on a 24-hour champagne diet
Spilling while I'm sipping, I encourage you to try it
I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it, boy, I'm on that fly shit
I am what everybody in my past don't want me to be
Guess what? I made it!
I'm the motherfuckin' man, I just want you to see
Come take a look, get a load of this nigga
Quit fronting on me, don't come around
And try come gas me up, I like running on E
I-I'm on my Disney shit - Goofy flow
On records I'm Captain Hook and my new car is "Rufio"
Damn, where my roof just go?I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shaking somethingcause that's what Drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for
Like leaving girls that love meand constantly seducing hoes
I'm losing my thoughts I say, "Damn, where my roof just go?"
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl


They can't help it and I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous, but Bitch! I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow

[Verse 2 - Birdman]
Yea,richer than the richest,we certified getting it

Higher than the ceiling, fly like a bird
Hit the Gucci storeand later get served
We smoked out, with no roof on it
Them people passing, so we smash on 'em
Ballin' up: we keep the cash on deck
Lamborghini and the Bentleys on the V-set
Louis lens iced up with the black diamonds
Cartier, Ferrari the new Spider
No lie, I'm higher than I ever been
Born rich,born Uptown, born to win
Fully loaded,automatic 6 Benz
Candy paint, foreign lights with my bitch in
Born hustling,too big nigga to size me up
Count stunting, more money - burn 'em up




When I get paid every 24 hours,money and the power
Come to V.I.P. and get a champagne shower
I don't have to worry because everything ours
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers
That kush-I promise that's my dude
But we don't smoke that Reggie Bush
And I'm with 2 women, make you take a second look

And we gon' be alright if we put Drake on every hook

{HOOK}

I'm about to blow you already blew it, oh you didn't know you probably never knew it
Silly girls going dumb acting hell of stupid usually she don't but she will if i let her do it

I don't want to take that route to rhyme so my own road I'm bout to drive it my turn hard grind hit a verse now it's mine
Yea it's me Killa  i began the ball game but i ain't playing got em gone from the fall game and this means i started with an art frame

Because you never even know the half what it's worth to me i do it for the love I'm not rapping to work for free
And everywhere its taken me at i deserve to be

{HOOK}Don’t it seem like
Like I’m always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time
A terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working
Made me an addict
There's way more people that want it
Than people that have it
I don't get it, I would hate to think I tricked ‘em
They fall victim to my system
Guess I sure know how to pick em
And I’m always her regret
Yeah, I’m always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
It goes up and down, it’s just up and down
She’s crying now but she’ll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
And expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she’s not the type to hold grudges
I’m wrong..


Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

Hung up off your good
You call and I run
My fam' is screaming at me don’t do it
"Don't do it, Mary!"
I guess they never had none



When he put that loving on me, I can’t think of nothing
That’ll make me walk out
I’m holding on
I love my Mr. Wrong
He be kissing and touching on me
I can’t help but love him
I must be out my mind
For going so strong
I love my Mr. WrongI wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when "fuck bitches, get money" was the new chant
It started out a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single


If ya'll dont like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend im just sayin man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin jealous when you paid, savin everything they made, I keep thnkin that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and im whats wrong with the game, but im feelin like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock,Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My cadillac meanbut my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice




Stacks on deck, lac's mounted on D's

And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze

My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica

But I'll be damned if another nigga do it first

I guess that mean you gotta run
Well holla at me when you done


Can I dig it
When you baby
Woop woop woop
My darling baby

I think about her and couple things come to mind
Thoughts like if she end up my baby mother fine

Oooh,I bet she so embarrassed
I had to take her ass to Paris
Give her the moments that she cherish
You know


Yep
She got it coming to her like an heiress
And anything she want I Will like Farris
Oops I meant ferris and in the coupe I tint very light
So them hating bitches can see me and you at every light
Oooh, andI hope its one of them long lights
I mean I hope its one of them long nights
No wrong turns, ain't no such things as a wrong right

No adjusting for you, you know just what to do and all
Yea, oh and I love it

I think the glass slipper does fit


And yesterday I told her she a muthafucker
And how her new haircut is so becoming of her
Oh thats your girl, well I'mma make a women of her

Yeah I'll spend my winters and my springs on it
And put a ring on it, eyy

The club is overrated baby lets not go
Lets stay home and burn a couple calories
Fuck the house up and make the maid earn a salary
Yeah I cook you dinner if you cook me breakfast
They say that nobodies perfect but you look perfected
I really love to be the one you took a step with
So trust me when I tell you it'd be worth the effort


Shes unbelievable like a purple leopard
Just give me the formula watch me work the method
Hehe, Weezy F, I prefer the best shit
And babe you the fucking best
You deserve a trophy
You could be my four leaf clover
Her clothes aren't tight nigga their cosy
And when she turn around they say Whoa like Joey
Thats my baby
And I love it
Yeah, Young MoneyI had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
I meant every word that I said
You should have spent more time listening
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a "hold on"
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long


Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love

And all the things I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a "hold on"
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long

Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
Alright so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ice so
What is about to unfold
No tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though
I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw
That is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world
Got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby


Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around


Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like �I ain't getting service in your area�
You be like �Nigga get your bars up�
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby! (look)


Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like
Fo real
This life shit is everywhere, you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take ya down through there
Make me wanna take ya down through there
I'll take it there


Why you never come to where I stay at?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay at?
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it? This isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw, man


Me and you are playing house, start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6


And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw manBa-Ba-Baby
This is something you should know, I don't ever chase no hoes
I spotted you, you had that glow, watch me pull out all this dough
Take you where you want to go, flexing on your ex, I know
He ain't ever take you out, barely even left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth when his pockets in a drought
The last single he put out didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy
I got deep pockets and I swear my shit's on sink, ayy
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, ayy
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap in her dreams, ayy
Well he mad as fuck, when they sex, she scream for me, ayy
Big ZooWap what these niggas should be, ayy


Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'ma start by saying this, ayy

Everybody tryna fuck you but I'm fine with that shit
I never mind, girl that's just you
I know you work hard for your shit
You know they gon' hate
Just don't play no part in that shit
They should call me James
Cause I'm goin' hard in this bitch
We're just so much smarter than them
Maybe I just needed you around me
Drank a lot tonight, I know
She can drive your car and you can roll
Take you where you wanna go
First off, I'ma start by sayin' this
Goddamn, goddamn


Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'ma start by saying this, ayy
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ayy
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ayy
Ba-Baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?I be driving up and down tough roads
I've be given her the best I've got!
Never will she take her clothes off in front of me...
Next week is her church meeting she tell all them good greetings
But, I bet she been bleeding inside from hater

I sweat on her breathing heavy tell her were meant to be baby
Don't leave me maybe U and me can sleep in on bed tonight

Honey bun, u don't want any of this its sick
And overwhelming...
​No matter what you do, it's never enough
​I don’t understand these bitches, Drizzy
​Trying though, they ain't never satisfied
​
​[Hook: Drake]
​Time after time after time
​Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
​But I ain't never satisfied
Yeah, I ain't never satisfied
​I found the one and say, "I'll never cheat again"
​We don’t talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied, I ain't never satisfied


I'm putting pressure on these niggas and I know
But I still be on the road like I'm scared of going broke
Cause I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied


And it's a lot of money in the room
I gotta find another spot, hiding soon
I mix the rosé with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up 10,000 ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she ain't got
Name a designer store that we ain't shop
They ain't never satisfied

No matter what you do, it's never enough
​I don’t understand these bitches, Drizzy
​Trying though, they ain't never satisfied
​
​[Hook: Drake]
​Time after time after time
​Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
​I ain't never satisfied
Yeah, I ain't never satisfied
And you can make it rain until your arms tired
As soon as it all stop them bitches just wonder why
They ain't never satisfied
They ain't never satisfied


Ain't no pressure on the money, Lord knows
But we still be on the road like we scared of going broke
We ain't never satisfied
We ain't never, we ain't never


And it's a lot of money in the room
I gotta find another spot, hiding soon
I mix the rosé with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up 10,000 ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she ain't got
Name a designer store that we ain't shop
They ain't never satisfied

There's a lot of money in the room
She said she wanna ball, wanna shoot some hoop
I put up big numbers for a new recruit
We just out here doing what young niggas do
Me and that boy Future could probably start a group
On some K-Ci and JoJo shit, have these bitches loose
Man, they know what it do
We got these niggas in the game stuck and they shouldn't move
I don't like sudden moves
Tell me how is it that every fuckin' verse get the rewind
And the watch cost too much for free time
And I hit the strip club, that's my me time
See I can't get much bigger, I'm that nigga, but they ain't never satisfied




Drake has confirmed the title of his upcoming fourth studio album, Views From the 6, though he won't begin work on it until after he returns from his 31-city co-headlining tour with Lil Wayne. The tour, slated to start after the Canadian rapper's OVO Fest, will kick off August 8th in Darien Center, New York and run through September 27th, when it ends in Woodlands, Texas. That tour, which is sponsored by a video-game manufacturer, will feature a nightly competition between fans of the two rappers.


The meaning of the album title is unclear, but the announcement is just one part of what will be a busy summer for the rapper.On July 16th, Drake will host ESPN's ESPY Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, where the ceremony will be televised live at 9 p.m. EST on the sports channel. The show intends to celebrate the best moments in sports with music, comedy bits and appearances by famous athletes.

Later in the month, Drake's label OVO Sound will release two records by artists he signed. Majid Jordan will put out A Place Like This on July 22nd, and PARTYNEXTDOOR will release PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO on the 29th.Drake recently made a guest appearance on the latter artist's "Recognize," streaming below via Rap-Up, which will appear on the album.

Drake will then stage OVO Fest in Toronto on August 3rd and 4th, when Outkast will perform and he will do his own set, with appearances by yet-to-be-confirmed special guests. This year, OVO Fest was awarded a CAN $300,000 government grant, which amounts to roughly US $268,000, as part of an initiative to help out festivals in Ontario. A press release claims the festival has sold out of the fest's 35,000 tickets.Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know

Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
I write so

Holla at me baby


I try to tell her I ain't seen a flier one
Denying some
I have desired some
But that time is done
Now I am gon'
Give it to you straight out of the bottle
No chaser, I've embraced one in lace, she was a model
Shorty jumped out of the closet even though I mean literal
Her girl made it figurative, or maybe that's what liquor do
Baby, that's the physical
Maybe if we spend a few days all alone on our throne I can get to you
I know you feelin' hittin' on the road is the typical
But I be in the telly, on your Myspace clickin' through
Your pictures
This bruh took a good game
But a fella couldn't Roc, I wanna Dash to my Dame
I'm sayin'
I know I be playin' too much

Ayo, the same chick from "Don't you have a man?" "Well..."
It all blowed over like Manuel
Noriega
She said she wouldn't marry the player
But she's the Tamia to his Grant Hill
Man chill
I thought you was my damn seal
In distress, rescue you from the landfill
She said, "That ain't enough protection
I need +Affection+ like Lisa Stansfield
I guess I can't be mad at this thing that you got

Re-negotiations
Young Frank I seen all of your favorite girls naked
Mental pictures were taken I never forget they faces
They're lucky I can't draw,but still I'm artistic
Money on the way It's got both of my palms itching
You boys in the wrong business. For real
You boys in the wrong business
All this sitting back and watching will make you a strong witness
Testify on how I'm living
Make sure it's non-fiction
Don’t leave out anybody that put me in this position
We couldn’t have done it better
We changed this city forever
Puffin shisha
Lay back fucking with FIFA
What I get for the feature I wouldn't fuck with me either for real
Now I'm in it for the hoes and the checks
Care less about respect from niggas I never met
ChampagneMoney makes a man and that's a crime
If we all were rich, we'd spend more time
With our daughters and sons, they're losing their minds
We all feel hurt,here's mine, hear me now


Cause, no guns are allowed, in here tonight
We're gonna have a free-for-all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd, in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts, turn the music up loud

[Hook:Snoop Lion]
Let the music play, me don't want no more gunplay
When the bodies hit the ground, there's nothing left to say, ay, ay
Me don't want to see no more innocent blood shed
Me don't want to see no more youth dead
Come hear me now



Yeah, yeah, yeah, news from back home
This when it hurts to be gone
Two more young names to be carved out of stone
One summer day that went horribly wrong
Got my dawg on the phone
Cryin' and sayin' to leave him alone, but I'm not leavin' his side
I know that somebody died, somebody's child
Some people ducked down and some people hide
Some people just cannot react in time
Bullets do not choose a victim
It is the shooter that picks 'em
They just can't wait to get you in the system
The district attorney could use a conviction
Told you no guns and then you didn't listen
Life is so heavy with that on your soul
Dedicate this to Shyanne and Josh
And pour sumthin' out for the lives that they stole

They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in, man
I got a blunt, can I get a light?
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like "you took the summer off? we couldn't tell"
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it




Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you been gettin'
We just never seen a visual
It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)
What's the word these days?
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know (WOOO)
Buncha' out of season woman
Fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season wardrobe (WOOO)
All the rappers that you vouch for
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, naw (WOOO)


I gotta keep watchin' for oppers cause anything's possible, yeah
There's no code of ethics out here, anyone will take shots at you, yeah
Niggas think they can come take what I got, let's be logical, yeah
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta then eat in the kitchen like i'm in the mafia
Houston, they get me though
European, my vehicle
How much it hit me fo'?
Ain't no tellin', yeah
What am I willin' to give her to get what I want tonight?
Ain't no tellin'
Please do not speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago
I'm at a higher place
Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears, I go huntin'
Put heads on my fire place, oh my
Take time, ain't no tellin'
Oh my, ain't no tellin'


They'll never truly know but
Thank you to all who try to understand
Nothing was the same
This album is dedicated to the memory ofEvelyn Sherand Bruce Smith“A lot of people get famous and then don’t want to be famous
You signed up for this you gotta pay for it. A lot of people
Just don’t know what the price is when they step up to the
Plate. The wear and tear is not physical. The wear and tear
Is a mental thing. You really just let go of a lot of relationships
That require presence and constant nurturing. You
Say goodbye to people, people get sick and die when you’re
Gone, and a lot of things just go by the way side. Then
There’s all the strife, and power, and money, and control.”I'm so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it


I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that mothafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on


I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slowbut I do it to her


Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning,get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end


Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw,Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feels like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm goneIt's over, it's over, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I can't stay here no more and I can't sleep on the floor
Man, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah, I'm leaving, yeah, I'm leaving, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm gone
I had to knock down the wall
Yeah, I swear to God that I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm leaving
No looking back when I'm gone
No looking back when I'm gone
No more (x16)


It's over, it's over, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I've been doing this wrong, I've been here for too long
I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid that I'mma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'mma be alone, I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road, I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit a road, I just gotta know the road
I just gotta know the road


Something to say then say that then
I just been out and bad from way back when
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
You got something to say then say that then
I just been out and bad from way back when
I gotta get on the road, I gotta get on the road
I ain't looking back no more, no, no, no
No more (x14)

You see bad bitches and fall in love
I be talking arithmetic in the club, re-negotiations
Young Frank
I seen all of your favorite girls naked
And mental pictures were taken, I never forget they faces
They're lucky I can't draw, but still I'm artistic
Money on the way It's got both of my palms itching
You boys in the wrong business, for real
You boys in the wrong business
All this sitting back and watching will make you a strong witness
Testify on how I'm living, make sure it's non-fiction
Don’t leave out anybody that put me in this position
We couldn’t have done it better
We changed this city forever
Puffin shisha,lay back fucking with FIFA
What I get for the feature I wouldn't fuck with me either for real
Now I'm in it for the hoes and the checks
Care less about respect from niggas I never met
Champagne


I know my city going crazy right about now
Broke nigga, so I'm greedy
Break a nigga down if they don't feed me
Yo girl break her neck the same second that she see me
And I bet my last nickel that she eff with Sweet Petey
Bradley Cooper, a future is limitless
I'm infinite, take a photo of the synthesis
Grandmama got Alzheimer's but she'll remember this
Ain't no way that she won't remember
I wake up every mornin' shower, gather my belongings
But I just quit my job, but got some pussy cause I'm balling
From AM to PM,beefing with the BM
Beefing with the boss, got fired by the GM
Fuck, I lost my nigga to a goddamn murder
In his own kitchen, with his own goddamn burner
You ain't no goddamn boss
You a goddamn worker
Fuck beef when niggas dying for a goddamn burger
My nigga, all we know is this pain
Chain smoking in the city where they smoke you for chains
Jamaica house to croaker spot, riding round smokin pot
On Broad Street we all drink -- PBR and Rolling Rock
Do this to get money, that ain't enough
Do this for my city, that ain't enough
Im like Andre 3k, 16 ain't enough
I get down like Curtis Snow
Dare you to call my bluff
Bet you it won't pick up
We ride box Chevys but we built Ford tough
And I bet you that we won't give up
The pigs try to lock us down
But we broke through cuffsTal parece que mi amor crece y crece
Pero tú desvaneces y me ofreces tu amistad
Sin otra excepción
Se que hay otro hombre
Que ha logrado lo que yo jamás a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir
Perdón por hacerte daño


Y por ti, vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio, aunque él te haga feliz
A mi nada me intimida, pero entiendo
Que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí


Celo sus besos, sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí
(Y te quiero aquí)
Odio ese hombre, porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada




Escucha las palabras
Yo fui el llanto
Él es tu sonrisa
Y lo nuestro desplomó sobre un volcán
Muy de prisa


Uh, you were the one
You've been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you - you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw 'em you'd get it
Look don’t worry about it,keep speakin' Spanish
I’ll get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy

I'm so tomorrow the Audemar says yesterday
Which means you on time delay
So even if I slow it dowwwwwn
My sound is fast forward, hold up
I'm just a runway show
But I wear that so my plane, these my runway clothes
Hehe,Cashmere sweats
They come out next year but these my last year sweats
And my ho's so sick
Your new chick can't fuck with my old bitch
And you know this shit
I'm professional, they novices
I just may let you borrow this
This the Blueprint, nigga follow this
This what what tomorrow is
Welcome to tomorrowBIIIIIIIIIII

[Hook: Drake] + (Jay-Z)
Whatever you about to discover we off that
You about to tell her you love her we off that
Always wanna fight in the club and we off that
But you can't bring the future back, back
Y'all are steady chasin the fame and we off that
Oversized clothes and chains we off that
Niggas still making it rain and we off that
Cause you can't bring the future back, back
Tell them haters get off me, the Cris' we off that
Timb's we off that, rims we off that
(Yeah we off that, is you still on that?)
(And we still makin money cause we still on that)


This ain't black vs. white, my nigga we off that
Please tell Bill O'Reilly to fall back
Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls
It's 2010, not 1864
Uhh, yeah we come so far
So I drive around town, hard top and it's off
Uhh, in myTriBeCa loft
With my high brow art, and myhigh yellow broad
Uhh, and my dark-skinned sis
And my best white mate, say what's up to Chris
Uhh, how's that for a mix?
Got a black president, got green presidents
"Blueprint's" in my white iPod
Black diamonds in my Jesus piece, my God
Uhh, we ain't tripping off that
This a Benetton ad,nigga been up off that, uhh




Uhh, uhh, uhh

You used to move, what you used to do
And I don't give a fidduck abiddout the bitches
That you used to screw, what your future do
And we don't really care what you used to say
Unless that affects your future pay
I'm on a practice field runnin Two-A-Days
So I don't drop the ball when it's threw my way
So I don't give afidduck abiddoutthe shit
That you probably did, who you probably is
The only time I deal in past tense
Cause I'm past rims, and I'm past tints
If you drivin it, I drove it
You got it, cause I sold it
You copped it, I bought it back
And we don't give a fidduck, nigga we off that

Are you feeling good tonight?
This thing got me thanking God for life
I just can't explain
I can't explain, no, no


Look, it's gon' be a long long time 'fore we stop
Boy better know, they better know who make the scene pop
All I ever needed was a chance to get the team hot
Only thing I fear is a headshot or a screenshot
Pree me, dem a pree me
You know they only ever call em when they need me
I never go anywhere, they never see me
I'm the type to take it easy, take it easy
I took girls in the very first text I sent
I don't beg no lovers,I don't beg no friends
If you wanna link, we can link right now
Skeppy Wiz and Drake, it's a ting right now
Are you feeling good tonight


When I was in school, being African was a diss
Sounds like you need help saying my surname, Miss
Tried to communicate
But everyday is like another episode of Everybody Hates Chris
Ever since mum said, "Son you are a king"
I feel like Floyd when I'm stepping into the ring
Just spoke to the boy, said he's flying in with a ting
We're touching the road to celebrate another win, we're going in
Why am I repping these ends? Man I don't know
The government played roulette with my postcode
All I know is it's where my people dem are suffering
I seen it before, narrate the story as it unfolds
Dad certified the settings and mu mum knows
My mind full of more bullets than your gun holds
Now I got the peng tings in the front row
Saying, "Skeppy come home, baby come home!"
Yeah, I love the sun but I respect the rain
Look forward to good times, can't forget the pain
I was the kid in school with the £10 shoes
White socks, jack-ups and the pepper grains
Said they're gonna respect me for my ambition
Rest in peace my niggas that are missing
I had to tell my story cause they'd rather show you
Black kids with flies on their faces on the television


Eh e kira fun mummy mi o
Ojojumo lo n s’adura
Mon jaiye mi won ni won soro ju
Ojojumo owo n wole wa
E kira fun mummy mi o
Ojojumo lo n s’adura
Mon jaiye mi won ni won soro ju
Won ni won ni won soro ju


I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
Oh, I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah
I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeahVersace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week, man I guess I'm a optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like "What the fuck is he planning?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin' September, just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelin's cause business is business, its strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out where there's no paparazzi
I'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me


God damn, Oh my God (15x)


Real nigga movement, young nigga year
Lookin so fresh, you'd thought I was a queer
Feeling like homer simpson drinkin out a beer
Money in the front, with the lean in the rear
Get him out of here, swag of the year
Young Soulja Boy, I went and tattooed all my tears
Damn I had no fears, I feel like a bitch
Shoutouts to Lil B, I'm sitting on my dick
Pull up to the trap, hoes like damn
All this fucking money, bitch I think I'm uncle sam
Tatted on my wrist and my clip don't jam
Soulja Boy Tell Em, in the kitchen cooking yams
Trap goin ham, speakers going hammer
Took your main bitch, then I bammed her and I bammed her
Yeah, I rammed her than I jammed her
Nutted in her mouth
I fucked that bitch in AlabamerYou finally start to care
I show up so unprepared
You're ready for something new
I'm still where I was last year
Meanwhile we're talking it out
You keep leaving things at my house
Seems like you're wanting to stay
But you need to know..


I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find
You want a man, I'm just a guy
Busy as fuck, you know what's up
Now got a life, back where I stay
Still pay a car note for this girl, around my way


You got the game and the talk
Keep turnin' out how I thought
Kept my feelings on low, all alone
Intuition never ever wrong
So what the hell, mix some vodka with Italian
Carousel, hitting circles I'm a stallion
And I'm a real one nigga, I'm my own med
You looking so damn thirsty, let me throw it back
Baby we are on to something, maybe if we had the time
Used to give my love for nothing, trust me, I'll be alright


I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find
You want a girl, I'm on my grind
Busy as fuck, you know what's up
I got a life, back where I stay
Alicia’s still my only girl around my way


Yo! I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt fake,worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John &amp; Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens, unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me: Lance Stephenson


Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only


I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "god damn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, lowkey or maybe highkey
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck just give me the heads-up
So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, aye)


Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only


I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy,treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga, I been praising, my nigga
That money talk; I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "B" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"


Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, onlyThe clock that you’ve been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait
What kind of man does that to a girl he loves
If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands will say
They'll say


Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don’t show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need’s an address and I’m on my way
Don’t fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it’s worth waiting for
Because I’m on my way


Won't hurt, it's just some turbulence we're dropping
Dont be afraid
If you fall right here in love with me in my bed
I'll keep you safe, so safe




Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way (x4)I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and backbut I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over


Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it


I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and backbut I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over


One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'mma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it,uh


I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and backbut I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right, I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from overI said I used to keep the porch lights on and now
I keep the Porsche's lights onjust to let them know their foresight's wrong
Where this rapper goin' with that obscure ice on
He a lame I'm just tryna get my mature life on
OD OD, everybody know me
Even fans that resemble them kids in the O.C
Oh me oh my them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip get a glass pour the X.O. in
I dare one these niggas to say that I'm not insane
Pick a road cause where you drivin is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C life is not a game
Taking over the world no Pinky just a lotta Brain
He bout to send them the shit that I'm on
You prolly could have predicted I'm on
My sense of judgment is officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the swisha is blown
I'm grown, I'm grown I'm livin' in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high I'm never comin' down
And you say you got them hoes but they never comin' round
I got Penthouse walls, I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifey's over (bitches)
But moneys over (her)
Cause money's under (nothin')
My life is such a (blur)
That's not the way it has to go it's jus what I prefer
And do not disagree with me it's best you jus concur
I'm a legend with a legacy that can't help but survive
Even when I fuckin' die they gonna bury me Alive


And I'm so prestigious, I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight no creases
P P P Peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air... we good (O.D. O.D.)
Bithces over there... we good (O.D. O.D.)
Money on the floor we good, O.D. O.D everybody know me

Oh no Travie high on life again... (Wow)
Feel like I swallowed a whole bottle of Vicodin... (Dam)
So high I wanna cry like tiny violins
In my best mode Depeche Mode enjoy the silence... (Shh)
Stop the violence, how when every line I write
Is like the motherfuckin Watts riots pouring out of my pen
Iight dam be easy I'm a get back
Gentleman with a superlative use of syntax
And I done gave up the narcotics but I can't leave the crib without some xanax in my wallet... (Nope)
Hello my name is Travie and I'm a life-aholic
Told'em all these beats is like the Wallace to my Gromit
The Alfred to my Bruce Wayne, stripes on my candy cane
One without the other, Soul 4 Real without the Candy Rain
Super trooper like a gun-toting handyman
Ask me how I'm livin bet I tell ya fine and dandy man
Check his vital signs, they peakin' off the meter man
I'mma live forever in Neverland with Peter Pan
Fuck pulling the nine out
I'ma pull a Amy Winehouse
Sippin' Purple Rain with Mary Jane girls in my house
Isaiah I'm a see ya when I get there
Until then hold me down like gravity it's Travie...Uno...Easy




Ha I’m bout to overdose on life somebody please pass the needle
So if I comatose tonight you won't have to ask the people
If the things that I seen through my Prada frames got me paid
Watch me mane I'm cocky slave with this Rocky chain
I got I got my veins cluttered with this bud
And this name of it is Fame and it's all up in my blood
Tyna suppress the too fresh feeling I got... Oooo yes
I'm in it for the hugest duplex, livin' like I'm Hugh Hef
Every other night I need a brunette for group sex
Leaving with a bruise neck then I yell whose next... (Next)
Stand 'em in a line this is New Factz City
Take this crack between your thighs(Yeah)
(Mickey what you mean?)
I'm promethazine fuck the queen
Sniff the white horse of success and then let him lean... (Let'em see)
Tryna match my high on life... (Then let'em dream)
Gotta catch the spot on my flight
First class known of the aroma of the smoker life
Got me like a stoner, a zoner but nah it's never over
(Mickey what you mean?)
I stick my tongue out sippin Remy conceited of I'm teasing every bum out
Hung out with celebrities from every drug house
So when you remember me say that I was strung out
I'm an addict for the green cash I'm a O.D
So fluck going to rehab

Girl this summer, you'll be looking for
You’ll be looking for me while I’m riding in
That brand new whip you wanted
All I ever asked for was patience
(That's all I ever asked and you know it)
Patience and pussy but mostly patience
(Cause you gon' use it anyway)
Swear I used to keep you waiting
Now you're waiting for something better
But girl what's better than this
We were supposed to do big things
Now you're waiting for something better
But girl, what's better than this?


Popping champagne over here
Girl it ain't a thang over here
Throwing money fast over here
Blowing all this cash over here


Me and my niggas bucking head first
You supposed to be there when my head hurt
Used to be going out hardly, now we wanna party
Celebration on me, wellwhat's up
Pay homage,I roll through the city like young Sheikh Mohammed
It can't be that hard to find us
Go to Jungle, pick up my Ethiopian goddess
That's when words spread, a Bugatti is in the projects
The boy home, used to take the bus to the block
Now summertime whips come through and bust up the block
I remember seeing Nikk's having to bust up a block
And sell the work right to hush, y'all niggas must have forgot
But I was there Nas don shit,a couple things sit on my conscience
With that said, look at all we accomplished
Yea, sure this ain't Compton but this ain't a fairytale land neither
We all lost mad people, the city wild
They gave the task to a purposeful child
Verses start to get a little more personal now
But that’s cause everybody else sound is so played out tho'
Oliver North in the cut Dolce'd out tho'
A 1000$ bottle it get poured straight out tho'
I'm screaming OVO on the whole way out tho'
I'm back boy for real, I'm that boy for real
I got hits nigga, you just a bat boy for real
Backwoods got peeled, I smoke away all the tears
Nothing was the same man, including y'all careers
The new Cash Money, the new Roc-A-fella
Bunch of young rich niggas, turn around if you jealous



I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club (mm-mm)
Fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah...It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright



You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah.. it's whatever
You know, feeling good - living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got 10 years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right




I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back but
What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'm going to do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

Drizzy


Bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas


Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours


Niggas talk more than bitches these days (Just let that shit sink in)
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryna have me on the
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time? You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours


Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, it's yours, it's yours, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, baby, own it, it's yours, own that shit, own that shit, own that shitWould've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know


I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, what’s up with y'all?
I hate calling the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to,did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember, I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all 4 members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains? The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck with,fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not saying I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

Too many women and not enough time
I'ma cool cat but I'm on life nine
Pimping ain't dead cause I be the life line
And I don't buy the bar cause it don't sell white wine
Goone let that light shine
Balling for a life time
Smoking on that nice pine
Weezy baby fly fly
You can call him your husband
Call me at night time andeven though women change I will always like dimes
And yeah I'm quite fine but shorty much finer
And I just get behind her thensmack it like E. Honda
And please don't hate on me when you see me with Kiana
Cause she's wilder than Nirvana and colder than your honor
Holla at yo' boy mañanaMaybach come wit a recliner
Run up on me and shit will get uglier than an iguana
This is only a reminder, its Young Money don't forget it
And I'mWeezy F babyyou might find it on her tittywould you


Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, Gucci sweat pants
She on that jubilee, I'll be the ex-man

Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee I'll be that ex-man


Chilling wit my posse 'bout to call some ladies over
Tell them this is YME so when you come you can't leave sober
You would think she came with buttons by the way that I control her
Put her on a tab now she rolling like a baby stroller
I’m the freshest niggas seen, reppin' in my jeans
Shoot your lights out, I’m like Redick with the beam
Life's a game of chess and I'm heading for your queen
Not my stomach and my thighs but her head is in between
She wetter than a streamI drink medicine to lean
Keep a cup in my hand like I'm begging for some cheese
I fall off in the party yeah I'mkinda tardy
But if a hater trip we ride on him like a Harley
Look you call it getting married I call it acting selfish
My belt got G's on it like a packers helmet
And I'mma hit if you bring your girl around
But the weed its like my collar cause I might just turn it down if you




Tool on deckI'm new born fresh
I knock ya friends down and you going next
Young money fly nigga all the bitches after me
Murdered in the bed and you gone be my next casualty
Automatic stick but I give it to her manually
I'm givin dick out year round and you can get it anualy
Styrofoam filled with a strawberry fanta treat
Leaning I'mma need a kick stand to stay on my feet
Get out my business like I kicked ya out my office
I ain't worried bout the price I'm more concerned with the offer
Fresh to death like I got dressed in a coffin
With a party in my pocket blue and red dolphins
I'm high as a motherfucker lemme do my thang bitch
I'm doing me and your girl doin the same shit
I'm in the car getting head as our lanes switch
Double G I do my thang bitch now you could




I told you catch up did you make a mill yet
I can't predict how many of them I can still get
October's Own, its such a fucking real set
No tats but the ink on my money still wet
Life is such a beach it's sandy all around me
I came here with Young Money man that's family all around me
I'm in my living room and I got Grammy's all around me
And famous bitches doing nose candy all around me
Welcome to the life the life is meant for me
My Bentley has a tint and so you got to squint to see
I hollered at your girl that's when she went with me
But please don't blame yourself cause it just wasn't meant to be
They say I'm one of the illest ask yourself for first impressions
And my cards always accepted I don't deal well with rejection
I look in the dictionary and don't see the word recession
I don't smoke in public but tonight I'll make an exception so just

Uh, It's 10 O'Clock on a Wednesday and I know your home (Know your home)
Driving up and down your street hoping you that come outside (Come outside)
Cause I just got paid and I'm winning bout to call you on it (Call you on it)
And I just need you to see me, oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Charlie says it seems that will make it all better (Better)
Selfish says it is, this just ain’t bout you, no (bout you, no)
Did me wrong every time we were together, gether
So that’s why, I’m gonna stunt on you
I’m gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could have made it all on my ownOh yeah, Magic city on a Monday
Esco treat that shit like church on Sunday
Niggas look at us like ‘maybe one day’
Maybe one day, maybe one day
But for now a nigga got the ones with me
I be in the club with the bands
Like I got the keyboard and the drums with me
Maybe one day, maybe one day
You will understand how I get it though
Man, it’s everything I ever said it is
Mixin' liquor cups with the sedatives
I roll up with the bands on me
This a good night to dance on me
This a good night to dance on me
This a good night to dance on me, oh


Yeah, last time they seen this shit it was BMF
I know Big Meech and J-Bo, they were there
I know OG India and Suga were there
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Bust it out the wrapper, throw it in the air
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Throw more money on a Monday than you make in a year
Oh yeah, order 60,000 ones
Told the owner ‘bout to break a record
Hit the parking lot, it’s looking like a video
Bunch of pretty hoes, high sadity hoes
Whole lot of Xans and we pass them around the table
Magic City on a Monday
We worship this like a Sunday
Oh yeah


Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume, go, go


I recognize your fragrance, hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic,you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, P.S


You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song


I really hope you play this, cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in,it don't make sense
Young East African Girl,you too busy fucking with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but Goddamn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, P.S


Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours trulyand right before you go blind,P.S


You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song


"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"

Baaaall baby...Drop that pussy, bitch

[Drake &amp;]
I’m young Papi, Champagne
They know the face, and they know the name



What you twerkin' with
Work, work, work, work, bounce
What you twerkin' with


Work, work, work, work, work, work
What you twerk with
Throw it, bust it open
Show me what you twerk with
Ass so fat need a lap dance
I’m in that white ghost chasing Pac-Man
Hundred out the lot,I be leaning that Ciroc
Hundred large bring a mop
Cars tinted like Barack
Got a Brinks truck in my pocket
Thirty chains on my collar
Two drops, no mileage
Top off like Wallace
And I’m inhaling smoke, bitch know that
Filthy rich before rap
Your new deal, I throw that
Three beans I’m on that(Haaan)
We pop a molly, she buss it open(Haaan)
She seen the 'gatti, that pussy soaking




I love my big booty bitches,my life a Godfather picture
Local club in my city, I fell in love with a stripper
Bitches know I’m that nigga
Talking four-door Bugatti,I’m the life of the party
Let's get these hoes on the Molly
You know I came to stunt
So drop that pussy, bitch
I got what you want, drop that pussy, bitch
Film it, film it, this bitch want me to film it
Balling, balling like I play for New England
Spend it, spend it, spend a stack every minute
That's 50...100, I see no fucking limits
Shout out to Uncle Luke
Shout out my bitches too
We the 2 Live Crew
Two for me, two for you
Feed them bitches carrots
Fuck em like a rabbit
Sorry that's a habit, smoke a spliff and then I vanish




I'm about being single, seeing double, making triple
I hope you pussy niggas hating never make a nickel
It's good to make it better when your people make it with you
Money coming, money going, ain't like you could take it with you
It's about to be a hit right now, fuck back then we the shit right now
Dropped Take Care, bought a mothafuckin' crib
Picking up the keys to that bitch right now
OVO that's major shit, Toronto with me that's mayor shit
Gettin cheddar packs like KD, OKC that's player shit
We don't dress alike, we don't rap alike
I shine different, I rhyme different
Only thing you got is some years on me
Man fuck you and your time difference
I'm Young Papi, champagne
They know the face and they know the name
Got one watch that could probably pay for like all your chains
And you'd owe me change, ah!
Greystone, twenty bottles that's on me
On the couch, wildin' out yelling free my niggas 'til they all free
One of my closest dawgs got three kids and they all three
But we always been that type of crew that been good without a plan B




Bitch! Stop talkin' that shit
And suck a nigga dick for some Trukfit
Okay I fuck a bitch and I'm gone
That’s gangsta: Al Capone
I make that pussy spit like Bone
I'm talkin' 'bout bone, bone, bone bone
I’m fuckin with French, excuse my French
I lose my mind before I lose my bitch
Money ain’t a thing but a chicken wing
Bitch I ball like two eyelids
YMCM beat that pussy up, stop playin'
I make her ass scream and holla like rock bands
I’m a beast, I’m off the leash
I am rich like a bitch
On my Proactiv shit, pop that pussy like a zit
I go by the name Lil Tunechi
Your girl is a groupie
And nigga, you's a square
And I will twist you like in a Rubik's
Motherfucker I'm on my skateboard
Watch me do a trick ho
I’m 5′5” but I could 6-9
Then beat that pussy like Klitschko
It’s French Montana, fuck Joe
It’s Weezy F, fuck hoes
It’s Truk the world
It’s Truk yo girl
It’s Trukfit by the truck load, biatch!

Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days.You know, years ago they had the A&amp;R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it.We had the champagne in the studio, of course, compliments of the company,and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball.Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...


After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now?
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are


I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homies said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em less is more niggas, plenty of us


Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelins
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[, Produced by Detail]


Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and not say I'm the greatest
Of my generation, like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behaviorand not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it"
It's worth it to share 'em with someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dog
Nothing was the same, dogI can tell that money's got you working
We've been talking for so long
Now we're finally here in person
I taste pain and regret in your sweat
You've been waiting for me, oh-ho
I can tell that you been practicing
I can tell that you been practicing
All those other men were practice, they were practice
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me


Girl you look good won't you back that ass up
You a fine motherfucker won't you back that ass up
Call me big daddywon't you back that ass up
Girl who is you playing with, back that ass up
You working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah


Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash yeah, his last yeah
Hoes frown when you passed yeah, they mad yeah
Couple thousand on your bag yeah,fuck yeah
I'm a Big Tymer nigga yeah, money flipper yeah
Get it understood yeah, it's all good yeah
Girl I know it's real cause I've been around it
You only want what's real you just never found it
Don't give them no more chances, oh girl they had their turn
Everything for a reason, there's things you had to learn from them
But when I get you to myself
You know what's going down, what's going down




I know he messed up
But a let a real nigga make it right
Let a real nigga make it right, you deserve that much
Let me put something in your life
Let me put something in your life, put something in your life
You telling me it's only been a couple other people that you've been with
I'mma trust you I'mma give you the benefit of the doubt, and I'mma love you
You can even call me daddy, give you someone to look up to

All my girls from the 504
Need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now

All my girls from the 504
Need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now

All my girls from the 504
Need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now

All my girls from the 504
Need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now

After you back it up then stop
After you back it up then stop
Babygirl, after you back it up then stop
After you back it up then stop

I'm in Miami
I need to call up Miss Cassidy
My name is Party, not participation
Sorry for the miscommunication
I need a drink and some tequila with you
You know what I'm trying to do
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv
I've got some time here to blow
I've got the money to blow, I've got the money and blow
Don't have to guess how I know
Oh, it's a secret, trust me, I'll keep it
You old niggas boring as bones
You put the PARTY tape on
You know what's going on, you know what's going on
She keep it wet like tsunami
She think she sunk the Titanic
I get her hot like Wasabi
She think it's wavy and gnarly
I think I'mma pop one for you
Drink one for you


Still in Miami, most of these girls are too messy
I've got to do some reflecting
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type, yeah
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight, yeah
PND ain't with the ray tay,you know Jay Wray
Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days
All in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes
You should be afraid



I'm preaching, oooh
Preaching, preaching, babe
Preaching, whooo
I'mma finally, finally, yeah

Notebook, Notebook
Trapper keeper paper
Willy Wonka's in my closet, all these flavors
Shop with me you'll get exhausted
Broke niggas stay out of Dodge
They just can't afford it,yellow star ships
Walking out the men's department
Now look at that bitch riding with me, ain't she gorgeous
You 747, I'm G4'in, snoring
Paper like the NBA, balling
No look, big house, own cook
My chick exotic,bring what I want through
And I don't even tell them what I want
I just throw pool party's in my hotel room, and they come
Didn't know I'm famous, so she claim she ain't a groupie
You feed her McDonald's, I'm at Nakama eating sushi
Got a lot of loose leaf (paper)
Come down to that money, Boy I'm straight, no chaser, okay


I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash, and burning the rest [x4]


Tryna get this green, like I'm waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn't suit me girl,and every night is prom night
Where'd I put my bow tie, millionaire multi
Rest in peace to B.I.G, and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid, off of smart decisions
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a given
Someone please tell me the problem, with my competition
I ask, "What's up?", and they just always say, "The cost to living"
I learn from it though, I been down, and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club, and light yo' spot up
And me fallin' and landin' in love, I don't think should happen
Because everything easier to get into, than to get out of
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Cause the owner's always seen to be the only people with me
I'm still the mafia, I still run the committee
NY forever, nigga Diddy (somebody remind me where I am)


Now when it come to makin' money, I'm a printing press
And when it come to bein' trill, I'm the litmus test
Run it like a fitness test
And when it come to making history, I'm like Joe's son
A million ways to die, you already chose one
A million dollars stacked, it sounds like a new beginning
We on the top now, go back and tell the hood we winning
And while you're there, let 'em know I did it just for them
I made 'em cough the cash up and left 'em just a phlegm
Is that the King of the Trill
Go tell them Yes it's him
And his testosterone is up, who's got the estrogen
I like your girl and I think she like me even more
I hit her with that heave and ho and then I'm leavin' bro
The Dirty South's finest, and Dirty South's behind us
Now that's a plus on the report card, not a minus
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your Linus
You gotta problem with us
You know just the spot to find us


Uh, since you're tellin on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it howI
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around


They know I'm in a Port Arthur state of mind
Of the superstar status, I elevate the grind
My time is money, so I put some money on my time
Lightning on the brightening, so exciting when you see the shine
We’re on the level those before us never even thought of
I broke my bread and fed my team just like the Holy Father
I helped the blind to see it, kept it G, just like I ought to
The only thing that's left for us to do is walk on water
We playin' all four quarters till the clock expire
So till I see the ref wavin, I will not retire
My flow is still official, and I still got the fire
Can't take your eyes off me, like when you watch The Wire
And in oh-ten, we finna go in
So let the opposition know that there is no win
And I am no friend, so put your hand down
And tell 'em, stand down, before it's man down



Drizzy Drake mane, Young Sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Homesick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losin' track of time, everyday we switchin' zones
Drizzy Hendrix, I'm just backstage gettin stoned
Thank Me Later man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard nigga, I'm quoted more nigga
Results are in, I guess you shoulda voted more nigga
Swimmin' in the money, y'all just float ashore nigga
Never drownin', what the fuck you think this boat is for nigga
Yeah I'm quick to take a R&amp;B diva out
I bring some friends, she brings some friends that know what we about
And when it's done, I put my slippers on and see 'em out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women livin like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just really tryna keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, seek just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler, everyday I'm ridin' clean, damn

Yea,Drizzy baby
You already know who it is
It's the first time I'm high
It's the first time I smoked in like 3 months
I'm sorry mama, I had to do it to them
40 I see you
O, I see you homie
I stay late tonight right?
You know what happen when I stay late
Yea,Boy wonder
I swear it's like this every single time
Toronto I got you

I'm a hard guy to get along with
Get on a song with
When shit be going right, well I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to
The artists I put on with
Don't ever ask for nothing cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it "playing checkers"
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money I'll be happy to connect ya
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the President
Someone cut the lights on!Where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you trying to zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers are liars and their women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
And he got it for me and I'm as happy can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off a rebound
Yea, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because the nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they trying to get their swagger right
Cause I dunn came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You ain't heard of me then you should go and get a Blue's Clue?
Oops! I mean a red clue
Wayne's here, Soo-woo!
Bet he felt like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake I hate to see him so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on the Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny,Banks like Ashley
Burnin' like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And no the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth then pull the zipper down and see
No homo though


Yea, um, I'm going in!
Drizzy I got us, this is my promise
Ima bring the barrel to them bitches eyeliners
And what I make up, will fuck up your skin
I pick buck up and buck-buck then buck-buck again
I will butt-fuck your friend
Then suck up her twin
I put the buck-up to him
Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut, you duck, fuck your unloving kin
Now don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattooI had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude
Always had ablack tool
Even when I was at school
Cause bullies aren't bullet-proof
Red scarf, hoody too
Probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything as good as you no I do everything better
I get paid for everything for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone.Like a dog motherfucker I am going for your neck
In a sec, intercept
Bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up, yo I am heading to the buck like
Buck-Buck again.Might fly to L.A and just fuck Karrine
Nahh fuck Karrine! Lets get bucks again, and fuckin' spend
Them bucks and then, just fuck Karrine
If I told you I'mma do it, I did it
Got my city on my fitted

It is bout a minute past pissed and I'm about to get shitted
I'm with it if money is the it you want me with
And I prolly just spit on the chick you won't be wit
And I hate a boney bitch only like em only thick
And I own hip-hop, if you don't spit I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like Drake Drizzy Rogers
Or Drizzy Drake Rogers I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game I'm too willing to play harder
So harder I go, there he go
They chant MVP when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O.,Jas what it do
The haters are there facing and their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told ya, I get paid by the letter like
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y

And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox

Yeah shout the girls from the east who know what's good with me
Shout the ones from the west know what's good with PND
Stories of you and your girls is all I hear
Who do you fuck in the city when I'm not there?
(I owe you time) let's plan somethin' out when I come back from Europe
Swear I'm withholdin' my urges 'til you get this one-on-one shit like your name Katie Couric
I gotta get you those snow tires for your Mercedes, I'm glad you reminded me baby
All of these things slip my mind it's been crazy
Bite on your shoulder I know that's your favorite
Touching yourself to that video we made a month ago
You a freak and your cover's blown
How you talked me into sendin' that to you, I'll never know
Fuck it girl, I'm 'bout whatever though
Yeah I guess a nigga just believe in you
And that's proof for you
Could name a lot of things any other man won't do for you

Five niggas, six niggas, I ain’t give a shit about shit, nigga
(Girl I see you)Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
If you lookin for the good then we got in the trap like

Ooo wee

I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that I stayed in
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at amazing
Girls tryin SoHo lobby us
Hear 'em all screamin then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down
Chilin' wit' the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince he rep two up two down
Anyone I know get used to me
I'm far from the man that I used to be
I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providing that
Understand that I'm worldwide
You get it how you want it wherever you be residing at
Cause I do things from theM-town
To theUK
From Spainback out to Texas
This album's for my fans
But, yo, this hook is for my exes


This one is for you girl
You know who you are girl
You only show your face
Cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you trying to to make it
Don't ever mistake it
Girl my time is limited and I ain't trying to waste it all on you
You had a chance now It's gone
Oooooh, you had a man now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl


Ain't ya never seen a youngin' so fly
Lookin for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life
Tryin' to find another one tonight
And if it's you baby, let yourself be seen
Don't matter skirts, dresses or jeans
I got that work, know what I mean

Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We goLA,VA,NY, TO
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement

Guess me and the boy Songz is the replacement

Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up,we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move in to Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop

How he hate me when I never met the man
Woo! We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O


Meek Milly!
Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now its the Forbes list

I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find the pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go


Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boot purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first


Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, andI ain't a killer but don't push me




How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like oh well
You're like, "Fuck it, oh well"
My past behind me like a pony tail


Okay I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things you can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more Henny and you're past the limit
You told me 'bout the picture
Now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it


Baby I'm here, I'm here to stay,I ain't going nowhere
I know you're scaredcause you've been hurt, baby it's alright
Lost in your eyes, every time that you look in mine
Promise to be, all that you need, I won't leave you baby


No, cause I just wanna love you
I will never ever put nobody up above you
I just wanna kiss you baby, I just wanna hug you 'til the end
Baby 'til the end


Say you'll be mine, say we'll be fine, say we'll be together
Selfish of me to ask, since I be the reason we don't last forever
Wished that you knew all that I do to make this thing go right
Promise to be all that you need, I won't leave you baby


No, cause I just wanna love you
I will never ever put nobody else above you
And I say, good girl's got her mind right
She been raised right, being patient I know you waiting
Waiting on the good things when the time's right
You should let me get to know you baby
But I just wanna put it on you, if you want to
Baby tell me what you gon' do girl
I can make you feel perfect, girl you're worth it
I just need to see you work it girl




I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah yeah, woahCan you feel my heart is beating

Her days are over

I'm ready, I'm with it
Still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage
Well, I'm packed, too
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you, bang
The baddest woman ever and the hardest out
Proven over and over again
That's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money to the death
I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready, too
Hope it's somethin' that you thought about

Can you feel my heart is beating

So keep thinkin' you the man cause it's all part of my plan
I-I-I'm ready for ya

Can you feel my heart is beating


R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are overRound of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Let me see you, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and bust it, bust it (Drop it down and just)


Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the Twerk Team
Hair long, ass fat, shawty mean
That girl look like Halle Berry when I'm on them beans
When I hit the scene girls yelling and they scream
"Flocka can you be my baby daddy?" Yes!
Pimping like I'm Dolemite, hoes jump in my Caddy
Smoke like I got cataractin the strip club throwing up them stacks
Got racks on top of racks, bust that pussy make that ass clap, clap, clap
I ain't done with you, baby bring that ass back
Still got 20's, still got 50's, even got them hundreds
Throw some money, throw some money I'mma let it go
Waka Flocka Flame, better known as Mr. Let It Go




Bust it like you can't afford a car
You a star, you look in the mirror, you know who you are, right?
Cool, take it low, take it way lower than that
I fly private when I go, ain't no layover on that
Yeah I made it to the top, took a seat, still sitting man
I'm up in Stadium in D.C. still tipping man
She coulda paid tuition five times, still stripping
I just throw a couple bills, and she'll have a pair of heels
Oh no, there I go, magic tricking on your ass
Throwing every president except for Nixon on your ass
Make you rich, I feel like I should make commission on your ass
Wonder what you would ever do if I went missing on your ass




Throwin' them stacks, OMG, SMH when I'm on that stage
Pourin' Rose all on her ass, a round of appeal baby pop that pussy
Drop it down for me girl do a split,do you smoke girl? Gotta zip
White Rémy Martin, who wanna sip?45 on my hip
But I gain one deepand every word I say is slurrin'
Vision, man is blurrin', drunk too much liquor
Smoke too much weed, bitch I'm on too much E
I'm so high, y'all will miss me
In love with strip clubs, shorty I'm a big tipper
Two hundred then I pull down my zipper,ughh
Shawty say she want me and she wanna meet my crew, Squad
Niggas know we go hard, Squad


Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the Twerk Team
Bust it, bust it, like the Twerk Team
Bust it, bust it, like the twerk team
Bricksquad monopoly, shorty that's my home team
All the smokers they gangsta green, can't do no G talk
I need a classy girl in the bed, she ain't gotta be a freak ho
Bust it, bust it, lay down on that floor girl
Bust it, bust it, give me some more head girl

Hey there material girl
The neighbors told me that you're moving out
Leaving to witness the world
But are you sure that's what you're doing now

Are you running away for a purpose
Do you even know what your self worth is
The passport you carry in your purse is
The gift in the curse when you going head first is
The ATL, MIA, LAX, JFK
Luggage all packed and to them I say
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray

You wander the world
You seek what you've lost
You're waking up every day
The run away, run away girl
I turn and your gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
The run away, the run away girl

So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on
Your way
Run away girl
(x2)

Watching it all through the window
And wishing you could make it shatter now
Now that you're here on the other side
Are you sure it even matters

Are you living the dream
Are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems
Do you strip do you model do you live in between
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like

You wander the world
You seek what you lost
You're waking up every day
To run away, run away girl
I turn and you're gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
You run away, run away girl

So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on your way
Run away girl
(x2)I was running through the six with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
...running through the six with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Don't fuck with them niggas they too irrational WOOH


This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and WOOH
Yeah
You know how that should go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road !
Yeah, but you know how that should go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up they wanna mash it up WOOH
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you WOOH
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
And you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my...

With my...


Can I, can I save you from you?
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you've been sippin's not supposed to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do,yeah
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making a mistake I never learned from


I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you


Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before



Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playing you just drunk.You just saying shit
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait... No, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
Making all the same mistakes
And I swear I'm just trying to correct it
And I fall...

This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
And I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We could have worked it out
Uhh, But I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
But I'm gonna need you to say something, baby


It really sucks, butever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see
Your life is good but me and you it’s catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy
It's crazy, I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change
Ah, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect girl, now it seems we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?




I am the topic of conversation
This is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, cause it's 'all about location'
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You should have been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up, 50 - 50
Butnow I'm at the 40/40getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me andDwayne Carterputting out the hardest shit
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gonna be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these
Bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full
Now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets
Showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera
Someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married
I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness
I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment
You began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show
Embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed
To pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how
Cause I just seen my ex-girl
Standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear
We from a small town
Everybody talks and everybody listen
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez "Damn, Drake fly"
And he just be like "Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad
How could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records
And he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em"
Oh they did Poe
At least they tried to
And that's what happens
When you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you
However they decide to nahh
But 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would
Mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest
Could've fooled me
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type
And campus life is crazy understand
I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit
I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said cause this 'Ye shit you better kill
And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel
Problem with these other niggas they
Ain't never real
Yea ... that's all I can sayReps up, OVO, you already-


All my niggas so hungry, man they just eat what they kill
I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit
And like you just got traded
Girl you don't know who you're playin' with
Oh yeah, oh yeah, my sound is what up right now
I've been down, but I'm up right now
Nigga been backstrokin' and breaststrokin'
Through that lane that you left open
Man I don't give a fuck right now
Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low
'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla at me


Yeah, I got two tings comin' through
And they do whatever I want 'em to
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin' up forreal
I used to drive the Acura to school
Now I don't touch the wheel unless it's new
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin up forreal

[Verse 2: OB OBrien &amp; ()]
Passin' up on pretty women everyday ()
I like getting money I love getting paid ()
Bitches tell me that I look like 40 everyday ()
That's OK, I'll go and fuck them forty minutes straight ()
Hey, showing' up to 40 forty minutes late ()
Just send forty to The H and put forty in the safe ()
Damn, I got forty on my neck and wrist ()
OVO Sound boy, got 40 on the mix ()
Mix, all I do is mix ()
All my tings are mixed () and I make 'em mix ()
That means I make 'em kiss, I make 'em pop, I make 'em strip
()TOPSZN, I just sprinkle with my fingertips


Still, tell them bring the rider, get my roll on
Big timer tingle get your roll on
Tell them basic bitches they can hold on
I'm at the Hazey in the lobby with my robe on


Bring you to Habibiz, get your smoke on
I been going Hamilton for so long, yeah
This ain't a joke ting
I want the whole thing
I want my new ting, to meet my old ting
Let them get well acquainted, let them get hella faded
I'm halfway through the race and I'm already celebrating
I'm on that Y shit, I'm back on my shit
I ran the game so long I should be wearing Dri-FIT
Oh yeah I'm poppin' again
And it kills me to yell out free Baka again
But free Baka again,and free Greezy one time
Shout out Sammy and Peezy one time, you know what it is


Flight risk on my right wrist,I been cookin' up to feed everybody
I get a chicken one night, about it
We'll fuck your bitch and then write about it
Made a half a mil went and bought a choppa
Cause nowadays you can't kill without it, BOW!
We the stars, in the six, we the gods
Found the guns I'll beat the charge
I left the court screaming "Fuck the law, these hoes and all!"
I'ma star, like that steak nigga way too raw
Run the streets I hate the beef cause I take that shit way too far
Yeah, OVO the clique, I told Drake when we were kids
I'll ride with the 45 until the day we run the 6
Tell them niggas don't play it
Someone tell Flex drop a bombcause we made it
Hop on the jet and fly over to Haiti
Just so you know I was high when I made this, run up



[Breakdown: Drake] (x2)
You know, you know, you know (x3)
We call that schemin' up forreal


I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with this dodie
I fell in love with the rollie
I wake up, and pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control


I turned on the gas with a nickle plated
I sit back and laugh cause these niggas traitors
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
I came out the trenches, I really made it
I came out the gutter, I really made it
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it
Shoot out the car man, no lovey dovey
These bitches, they lookin' for hubbie hubbie
I'm lookin' for paper in any city
I got a bitch located in every city
Gotta have 'em sticks on us in every city
Take the private cause lately out here we gettin' it
Spent like seven hundred thousand on both of the Bentleys
I got love for the city, I jug and get it

[Hook: Drake &amp;]
I wake up on a daily basis
I count the money man, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with the dodie
I fell in love with the rollie
Wake up and pray every morning
Demons, they callin my soul




I need acknowledgement, If I got it then tell me I got it then
I'm ballin' outta control, keep on receiving the scholarships
Mayor comin' to the house, nigga please, watch your mouth
I'm the one without a doubt, yeah
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted, I'm gettin' choose by these hoes
Usually they just leave when we done
I don't wanna share no room with these hoes
Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change


I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with this dodie
I fell in love with the rollie
I wake up, and pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta controlLook, here we go
The first time around
I left the cars at the house and I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go its about the rhyming now
Im seeing it clearer the season is nearer
And still I must change
Im like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm outspoken still
They not sure of the work but they all hoping he'll
Emerge to victormy words are pictures
And guess the colours so loud that you heard my scripture
With 4 walls give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I've been thinking before y'all
I barely get tired I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week what I'm daily required
I meet quotas while you rappers having sleep-overs
Spending nights in the studio trying to beat Hova
Be in the throne instead of being your own
But Look


I'm making moves in my city so
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls is steady tryin to get with me though
Important and vital I'm caught in a cycle
This is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain it, my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king nigga its the same thing
All day long
But thats a screw face
Rappers befriend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping they slip and trip over your own shoelace
Thats why I tuck em in not giving a fuck again
D.R.A. you add a K.E
A couple mill and you labels cannot play me
I never go broke I'm far from a flash in the pan
I am a passionate man, plan it with cash in my hand
Uh


I got few days left
But I'mma make use of every single one until every singles done
Until every record is sold, and every string is strung
Tell me take a breather Drake and everything will come
Dog its always been the same
Its all love like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in the driveway
I roll down strips and hose down whips
That when turtle wax up they would close down Richmond
With no down shifting
Haters would say I'm adequate
Think I got the type of flow that would make an addict quit
21 years I've been pimping since being
Repurchased trap music 4 times since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince
Getting pennies for my thoughts
So I put my two cents in
Top of the morning I am dropping the coin in
Plus I'm changing the game
You hear me swapping the joint in
They put the fires out and bring the buyers out
And try and box us all together before they buy us out
If they profit from the events we handing flyers out
Then we profit from the attempts to hand desires out
But rich is how we all ending up
I'm at the label in the elevator send them upVerse:
Yeah yeah uh
I'm feelin' you, gauranteed that you into me
I got the phantom, the aston, the bent-e-ley
But let me tell you where a nigga at mentally
Two things I don't give a bitch: pay checks and sympathy
Ha! but I guess it's just the pimp in me
All around paid, can't even get a sentence free
So judge a nigga sweetheart, sentence me
I ain't worried it's gon happen if it's meant to be
And if you ever feel the need to step inside
Be a woman about it and know we living seperate lives
Trying to tell you, less feelings mean less goodbyes
That's some game for your ass, better recognize
But some cats can't even relate
I ain't a mind reader though, so if you tryna escape
Then let me know that, show that
My place, roll back, lay down, so flat
Tell Me!Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now
Su-woop to the bangers
Su-woop to the bangers, (yeah)
And I say, I be on some G shit
I be on some G shit
Check out what I done, and
Check out who I be with
I'm me bitch, I said I'm me bitch

Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love
Cause I don't have the time for thatt
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggas for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

I a'int have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight?
Ladies say, I ain't have sex in a long time
I a'int have sex in a long ass time
Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight

Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now
Su-woop to the (whoa oh oh ohh)Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davisand my connect up at Avis
Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
I'm celebrated at home and
I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait 'til I get my money right and
I am going to ball ball ball

I tell her "now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!


Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

Haters can't see me but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about "I", give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'm-a have em checkin pulses
They say "choose wisely" that's why I was chosen
Rocking like the asphalt,it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!

Pandemonium, she cause that
Toss it up, and I stuff 'em where her draws at
That's on everything like feets that's on my floor mats
Red bottoms,spikes on 'em, that's dos stacks
Speakin' Spanish while she tannin', body no fat
Shawty body body got me on my 4th stack
Pink champagne,order Moët
Rollin' airplanes, where I land at?
I levitate over numbers you niggas never make
The Columbians callin',I tell 'em"perate"
Every summer I celebrate with a new estate
Let's get the fuck out this club, call it the great escape
She wrap her lips 'round a nigga, just like a chinchilla
Crap table Bellagio, I'm a big tipper
My life a stage I need her just to stand on it
Every time she look back, I toss a band on it

Fuck a car, my helicopter's in the parking lot
Shorty, and while you hope a nigga fit
Do a summersault and land up on that good dick



I mean forgive me for being so straightforward
But it’s been quite a minute since I’ve been here
And umm, I mean if you will
Just take a second to look around man
You know what I’m saying
Its a bunch of square ass niggas in here
And I know you don’t do this often but I’m the exception
Do it for me huh, pop that pussy for a real nigga ma Lets go


Say bruh, I’m so official outta sight
What’s about me not to like
I put that pipe inside her
Like my diamonds are her guiding light
I’m dynamite, K-I-N-G, P-I-M-P, admire me
A plethora of fine freaks trailing right behind me
Killin shit dead, turn the club to a crime scene
Pocket full of money like I run a crime ring
Million dollar chain, everything shining
It’s safe to say I do my thing honey, nah mean?
Bunch of young hoes know Chinese
In bed stuck together like they siamese
I run in rod way to feel her, she say “Gah-lee”
I say I’m tryna touch her heart, close ya eyes, breathe
Now she running from me, but she ain't tryna leave
I keep a quarter key of pussy thats a nine piece
Legs open curtain closed, rock solid hurting hoes
Buss it open, sure she will, who else is there to do it fo'
Fo’sho


She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and tell me “baby, its real”
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
Yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will

Yeah, I tell her “now go on, pop that pussy for me”
Haters can’t see me, but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
The money, fame, and power, I ain't seen it yet
But people linin' up like "I wonder what we can get"
It ain't a problem, but when I know this my friends
Coming back when there's some ends and running back when that shit ends
It's kinda funny, I guess the money makes them act a little strange
It don't change the person with it, just the people in yo space
I'm spacing out, my brain is orbiting
I stare up at the galaxy at night like I'm absorbing it
Cause that's my only pal, there ain't a doubt in mind
The only one that I can turn to when I'm out of time
You treat your life well, that bitch will treat you fine
There's always silver-lining, just read between the signs
The great divine rest upon my shoulders
I was meant for higher purpose those of us who wear ?
I'd live forever if she let me hope she will
Cause this life is just to good to be this real


Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will


It's hardwired in my brain, the music thang
That's the gift that life has given to me like a fuel to flame
And see my gift back is what I am because of it
The game is waitin' on me cause they know I'm on some other shit
Sometimes you gotta take a step back and ask yourself
"Is it my time yet, what am I after?"
Well, I'm after wealth but that's the big picture forever
So meanwhile I've been playing chess up on your checkerboards
I'm breaking all the rules
I'm in the fast lane holding up the traffic moving carefully and past games
They say the one's that have it all, they took the time for it
I want the world in my palms, I've got the time for it
Cause this is my life, I'm in control of it
She's worked all of the pain and all the years that I was broke for this
I'd live forever if she let me hope she will
Cause this life is just to good to be this real

Anit no party without Greek
Catch me in da streets,rolling with elites
Ooo  you sleep on me,the reaper you will  meet
Its domes day if u meet me,your flow not even knee deep
So catch me up in my homie jeep
M.j , Tyson , Jordangames 6,my flow raw yall PG
Haters watching me like t.v.im going in low key
By the time you realize its over B
Yall niggas  not in the same league
Im outta space  im hard reach


Talking 'bout you popping tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talking bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit


Took niggas out the hood like I'm from there
So you know it's all good when I come there
I hear you talk about your city like you run that
And I brought my tour to your city, you my son there nigga
But I had to come through for the remix
On my haven’t done a verse in 8 weeks shit
And if a nigga say my name, he the hot shit
But if I say the nigga name, he still the hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I don't feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they don't know, but they should know
Yeah, I just think it's funny how they dangling the bait
But I'm the one that's killing niggas on the hooks though
And niggas ain't got a grill, still ice grill hating
I know y'all already know Mike Will Made It
Just looking at the numbers, nigga, I feel amazing
I call Michael Jordan up and Mike will make it
I'm the young rap nigga with the 'Melo deal
You need to come to OVO for a better deal
Just know a million ain't shit once you get a mill
And niggas say it’s all good, that’s how you better feel
Nigga nah, fuck that, this year I'm talking big stuff
Rolling through the city like a young nigga bricked up
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That's why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up




If money talk then your pockets ain't saying shit
I'm in the bathroom getting head from your bitch
And I ain't paying her shit
You want beef? You don't know who you playing with
I tell my pilot to land the jet
I'm hopping off, get 'em, we popping off
Give a click and you niggas dead where you standing at
I'm just a trippy nigga smoking on cabbage
Your money funny like Jim Carrey
I got bitches that's super bad like Halle
And we still keeping that white like Barry
I'm a rich nigga, still keep a pistol with me
Nigga you ain't fuckin' with a picture of me
I got all this cake and shooters with me
Just in case you pussy niggas try to get you a piece
What it is, my nigga? What it's hittin' for?
Where the car you were whippin' in the video?
Where is the ice at? Where is them pretty hoes?
You a fraud, real niggas already know
Broke ass niggas I can't stand them
I hit 'em with the cannon
I buying out the mall at random
Juicy J that nigga is fresh to death
Smoke till there is nothing left
Bail off and then I'm ghost in my Phantom

I show love, I show love
I-I show love, I show love
I-I show love, I show love
I-I show love, I show love
Yeah, yeah

[Hook: Juvenile &amp;]
My people tell me they love me
Showing up in my shows
Man, I'm still down and I'm thuggin'
And everyone of y'all knows

(Rich Gang)
Still down for my niggas
Still down with my bitches
Wanna drink somethin', wanna smoke somethin'
Wanna turn up then I'm witcha

(Rich girl)


I show love to my dogs, my dogs is all that I got
Cause where the fuck would I be
If it wouldn't have been for my block?
Standing up in the hall, I got my first experience with rocks
Then on came them laws and almost everyone done got knocked
It still feel like yesterday when Magnolia Slim got shot
I don't know why they got 'em though
Cause that ain't the way that he rock
I told  Ms. Linda "I got you baby, my heart is yours til it stops"
I do this cause I got real love, I don't do this shit to get props
Hurricanes, it took everything, but there's money still to be got
I'm staying here and I ain't never leaving, I'mma live in here 'til I rot
Haters always gon' talk about you, ain't will never make it on top
Quick to tell you they real with it
And that's everything that they not




Slim and Baby that's my uncles
Man, I'm glad they brought me back
And Lil Weezy that's my brother
Fuck with him you gon' get whacked
GTV inside my cupand I got Trukfit on my hat
Screaming "Free BG" I wish he was here now to blow this sack
Turk and Mannie I got love if we don't ever make a track
Yeah, they tore down the Magnolia but this where my heart is at
All my homies, bitch, we ballin', no more roaches, no more rats
Taking pictures with the hoes and poppin' bottles of the 'gnac
I hug all of these females, I greet my niggas with daps
I holla at my old timers, I like the way they react
I don't care what set you claim, there's love here so relax
Reaching out to my family to spend holy time in these traps

I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya,I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me,can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded


Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says "I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it




How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out,let's get right, now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time


I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas that I came up with
That's my team, never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now




How about you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight, and worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl, can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate it when a backpack rapper get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could: it's in our nature
Young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though, so I'mma spend another 10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it
Yup!

Took niggas out the hood like I'm from there
So you know it's all good when I come there
I hear you talk about your city like you run that
And I brought my tour to your city, you my son there nigga

Nigga nah, fuck that, this year I'm talking big stuff
Rolling through the city like a young nigga bricked up
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That's why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up

Uhh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
All the girls they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures


Shut it down, you would shut it down
You be the baddest girl around,and they notice, they notice
You would shut it, hey oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you


Girl you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And put you in theLouboutins
What you want, what you need
I can be your everything
Them other niggasjust wanna hit it but if they had it
Wouldn't know what to do with itand together




TMZ, Concrete loop
You shut that motherfucker down
Ice cream conversationsthey all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down


Shooting Stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through andshut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining,they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin
And your cousin fine, but she don't have my heart beating in double time
You just shut it down girl,who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one? What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around its obvious you shut it down




You looking good girl, go get 'em girl
Go hit 'em girl, go, you shut it down

The way I’m feeling, things I say
All just happen when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late but girl I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type
You wanna do this rightand I’m not trying to say
I don’t believe youbut I refuse to feel ashamed
And if you feel the same,does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me lay you down


I’m trying to lay you down
You still the baddest girl around, they notice
Let me lay you down, trying to lay you down
You still the baddest girl around
And they notice they notice, you would shut itDRAKE:UHH UHH YEA YEA

I know that you're watching this from home
I can't wait to see you on the road
Cheering from the shadows I hear you calling out
Wifey sees a text and asks what's this all about
I tell her you're just a friend
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end
I'm asking would you be mine
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45
I had a rough game I took two shots I was 0 for 2
Tough day I need that one thing only you can do
Skylar this is the one thing that I'd be for you
This goes out to all my side pieces
Side pieces, side pieces
This goes out to all my side pieces
You know that you'll never be the main one
City to city I see youwearingthe same one
Side pieces, side
Los Angeles I want you to make some noise for the real king of side pieces Brian McKnight one time


This is dedicated to all of the side pieces
I know you'll never be more
And you'll always be less
But there's comfort in knowing that you're okay being second best
I already got a starter but I'm looking for the rest of my team
Side pieces in training go on and wave your hands for Drake and me
(Don't be embarrassed)
Side pieces where you at?
(Probably in the top balcony)
I know you're not down here in front of us you got to be way back in the back
(They can't even see us)
Side pieces go on and be, side pieces yeah
Side piecesHey girl

That way you can call me
Every time I come into town
And then I will
Drive up to your house and
Take you out to dinner

Chorus:
But what if we happen to kiss

(maybe we should slow it down)
Slow slow slowI see you sitting at home
Nobody's calling you on the phone
Your girls out making a night on the town while you're sitting there all alone
I suggest you come with your crew
Y'all are looking for something to do
Cause I understand pain is love and that's exactly why I wrote this little something for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you (Repeat x2)


Ladies up north represent representing
Ladies down south represent representing
When the mic is in my hand I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was Eric B For President, it's evident
She spend her summers in Jamaica and I love that
They say that she should be a model she's above that
She had a rapper break her heart, had to open her
So she don't even mess with rap, only spoken word
Well, I'm a poet so you know it's get her to going down
And after all this is my city I could show you round
I understand that the shit you facing is crazy
Let me hear your views on the situations in Haiti
Or sit back relax, vibe with ya man
Chill we could talk about Tribes in Sudan
Cause you gotta understand if I said it then I meant it
I understand that you Afro I'm tryna get to your centric
That's why I got a bottle of Champagne and then I sent it
Over where you sitting, noticed, pretend you didn't
Along with the bottle was a note attached
Here's some tickets to my show you should go to that
And it's a shame money's something that you barely need to knock her
I'm tryna treat her right cause she barely treated proper
But you showed up regardless of late choices it's clear
You really came to kick it it with Drake, Voyce and Amir like




Cause love (Love is in the air)
You know that love is in the air (You see that girl over there, I'm tryna make her smile you know what I mean, we gonna try and make a video later)
I should feel it everywhere
So smile (She fly, I think I see her friend over there too, you know what I mean)
So smile for me one time and I guarantee we gon have a good time (Cause ever since rewind we get full of girls like this man, it's just not even a thing...so uh)
Cause love (Hey girl won't you come here, I got a suggestion you know what I mean)
So smile (Why don't you and your friends, Get with me and my friends, maybe we could be friends you know what I mean, we could do this every weekend...maybe love is in it's self know what I mean, uh)Way to many holes, like I play golf
She’s somewhere in Wayne’s world, stranded, lost
Bitch catchin' feelin’s like Randy, Moss
Young Money shit, got the bathroom door locked
Tune go hard, y’all softer than my car top
Hank Gathers, I’ma ball til my heart stop
Nice red bone in a thong and a bra top
Lookin' for a queen from a king-size bed
I can make that pussy stand up and drop dead
Fuckin’ with Lil Tune then a nigga get murked
A nigga get kilt like a muthafuckin' skirt
I do it like Nike, I’m psychic I knew you like it
Run up in ya ass, than I dash like a hyphen
This is priceless, not for sale
And I unveil, Ms. Shanell


The feeling of your arms around me
I swear that I can’t get enough
I’m still focused on my shit but girl I’m up for a distraction
Got a body like a stripper, but tell me she a student
But some strippers are students, so I tell her ass to prove it
Ya know, yeah show me all your books and some id or somethin'
I just wanna know that you can teach me somethin'


Boy, you’re everything I need
I don’t wanna see you leave
I got time if you got me
Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood

Baby our song is on the radio
Our song is on the radio
Our song is on the radio (so turn it up)
Turn it up on your stereo
Cause Im dedicating this to you

Baby our song is on the radio
Our song is on the radio (so turn it up)

Boy, you’re everything I need

Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood

(Young Mula Baby, Young Drizzy)Falling too fast
Clearly rules don't apply
Can't believe that I just met you
You got me here
Watching minutes past by
Wondering when to expect you
There you go
Is this a dream?
Looking like every picture
That I've seen of you before
I've seen it all before


Now that it's over
I should of known better
Then you think this is real and
You could be mine
I should have known better
Slowed it down cause I feel
You needed time


But I kept thinking
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something

Maybe it's just nothing at all
But this could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something

Maybe it's just nothing at all
At all... at all
Maybe it's just nothing at all
At all... at all

I guess it's what we make it

I guess it's what we make it

I guess it's what weHow do I let go of something so real
You gave me a feeling that was unreal
You broke my heart and now its never going to heal

When somebody feels a certain way
There's nothing you can do or say
To change the way that they feel
Just make sure they keep it real with you
So baby keep it real with me please
It hurts to know you don't feel the way I do
It hurts to know I won't be the one with you

See I appreciate your honesty
But I just can't accept that you don't want me
Out of everyone I been through
You were the one I chose to commit to
The relationships I been through
Every ex I seem to bump into
They ask what happen to the old me
I fell for someone that don't even love me

Every action has a purpose
And every feeling has a cause
Every problem has an answer
Even if it calls for drugs
You were my other half
Girl you took a piece of me
You had my heart
Baby why you have to up and leave
What did I do to make you feel this way
What can I do to make you say you'll stayI forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I could do to fix it
(All you ever asked me for was time, whoa)


When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else


So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else [x5]


When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to

And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else [x5]


The girl or the world?
You see someone gotta lose
I thought that I can have it all
Do I really got to choose?
What good is all the cash
If it doesn't buy time
And what good is being famous
If I'm never on your mind
Nights fallen, lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort for my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga nice going
Is it worth it? That decision
Because hearts breaking and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'm a dust my shirt and fix my pants
Cause I better look good girl if this my chance, I swear


So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else [x5]It's 10 o'clock on a Wednesday and I know you're home
Driving up and down our street hoping that you'd come outside
Cause' I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see meoohhhh
Childish as it seems it will make it all better, better
Selfish as it is this ain't' just about you noooooo
Did me wrong every time we were together, gether
And that's why


I'm gunna stunt, on, you
I'm gunna stunt, on, you
You let me go
Little did you know
I could've made it all on my own


Oh Yes
Everything change but it's no different
But really it's like
Everything's the same but it's so different
I was always here when you needed me
Somehow I feel like you cheated me
I just wanted someone to believe in me
But you weren't there, you weren't there
You couldn't even make it to my first show
That's why I'm putting in this fucking work though
I'm becoming everything that I told you I'd be
I've been living like a bachelor no bachelor degree
I feel like the shit has ran it's course
I guess I never needed your support
Uh yeah man,VO
Back again like we never left huh
I'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so I'mma start off like this


Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh


(Yeah man; yeah)
You can't just love me like they do
(Talk to 'em V; I need somebody special in you girl)
I need someone special in you
(I know they out there somewhere dude; Ho!)
I know that out there theres a few
(Put ya hands up ladies; Yeah man)
See I've been searching I don't what to do
Can you help me?
(Uh)
She gotta be special
(Yea; You gotta hold me down baby)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
You gotta be special
(Yeah; You never know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
(Uh)
Gotta be special
Ever since the demo dog
And groupies are gettin' brave
Now they ask me for
Rappers, I write 'em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They won't sign so
Drake and VO back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh

(Yea; uh)
You can just love me like they do
(Vo we back man; Its a beautiful thing dog)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; I'm looking for somebody special man I'm serious; Ho!)
I know that out there, theres a few
(I know that they out there man)
See I've been searching, I dont know what to do
(Ho! You gotta help me man)
Can you help me?
(Uh)
Special
(Uh; yea; I need you to hold me down babe)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
Gotta be special
(Yeah; You never really know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
Special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be


Look theres requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of freshneeda aNiaorTyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe it's karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh

(Yep; ho!; Were makin history right now man)
You can't just love me like they do
(Yea; And you a legend for real, ima give you that man)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; Yea; I know they out there man)
I know that out there theres a few
(Ho!; Yeah uh)
See I've been searching I don't what to do
(You gotta help me baby)
Can you help me?
Special
(All around the world)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(From LA to VA)
Special
(Memphis Tennessee whats goin' on)
Cause you never know how people stick around
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yea my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "the first mill gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work


Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)


Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man


Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing


I do better with the rider in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we..

I'mma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house cause we...


No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame, cause we...

(Drake)

I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama’s house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think its funny how it goes
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show

You smell it as soon as I blaze
Burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound
Yeah, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down
Started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when I’m steerin'
Hope the homie Drake don’t get pissed
But niggas never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day
He wasn’t trippin', we just talked about the money we been makin'
Cause we…

Jody Highroller
Back in high school had a chip in front of my shoulder
But it's 2k13, still chasin' dreams
Done everything, got some diamonds on my rings
Range Rover aqua, break you off proper
Chop the block like a lobster,it's the freestyle doctor
Losin' ain't an option, haters can't stand me
I done broke a brick down on stage at the Grammys
Spilled syrup on my Dockers, break you off proper
Graduated hardwood degree, a martial artist
Hands-free phone, yep, I'm on my cordless
Neon boss, used to slang drugs
Fuckin' with them thugs got me not givin' a fuck
Versace shoulder shrug
Smokin' all these blunts got me buying new lungs



Oh ohhh, oh ohh

Damn, life's so short
Fuck, I don't wanna go to court
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer, though
Fuck it, I’m on the run for the money
I’m in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil niggas thuggin’, even got me paranoid
I’m gettin money, that's in any nigga category
Double M, I got G’s out in California



It bothers me when the gods get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesn’t come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y’all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don’t be ducking like you never wanted nothing
It's feeling like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from DC that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty M’s
Kobe my nigga I hate it had to be him
Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym
(Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said "fuck it", I’m tearing holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publixand take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet,told 'em butterfly it, she’ll love it
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fucking finish line, we can’t wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker getting mine off rapwith my niggas



From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dog
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog
Dwight Howard on the post, dog
My niggas got the powder through the post, dog
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the Feds
10 grams off my last 250 now
Big ass crib, 250 down, damn
Gave my nigga Max 7-5
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30
Fuck it,got me thinking like I'm 7-5
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30

Still...

Whipping the chevy, still getting my tipped licked
When I'm ready I still fall off intheparty like confetti
It's still mad rappers, D. Dot Angelettis
Still just as skinny as you met me
Still keep it real, never will let another disrespect me
For real, til deep in peace they rest me
Still smoke cess cause I swear that they stress me
And when I'm home a lot, keep the chrome a lot
Cause even when I'm home I'm knowin' there ain't a lot of dudes
That don't like the fact I'm blowin'
Like some running shoes on the track I'm goin'
Tell these other dudes they slack I'm sewin'
Don't get hemmed up, I think Timmed up
Cause in my mind it's the winter time all the time
I'm a grind
Tell em I'm a rhyme, told em that this sing got me signed
Try to put me in a box I will not stay there
And if I fall I will not lay there
Grown man, this is not daycare
A big boy game, they do not play fair
But I still keep it trill and I got this chair
Still uncomfortable if cops is there
My fam still dysfunctional, we not repaired
Still got rhymes out the asshole
Still wonder why are they mad for
Cause I'm in the hood like the crack-ho diesel
Ask yo people, Trey still do it for the people
Ride with some inter straps your whole fucking car is illegal
Still pick good over evil
Still play the Jesus and it's wild cause I'm still sinning
Addiction still weed-puffin, giving it to women
It's still my brain ready to bust up out my skull
To the mic, cause my mouth to be saying shit right
They saying shit like, I don't be killing it
You niggas is ridiculous, eat a dick or some syphilis
Die slow, still I done sucked it up
Drake tell em what the fuck is up



I used to cut the porch lights on
And now I cut the Porsche lights onjust to let em know their foresight's wrong
Where this nigga going with that obscure ice on
He a lame, I'm tryna get my mature life on
I asked what happen, or whats hattenin', hattenin'
Hop up out the passenger and help me back the phantom in
Damn, I never got to use that in a convo
Never got the chance to put you back in a condo
And, and
It couldn't be more true
I always meant to get you that villa in Corfu
Women I pass off, and money I tore through
Now all I really need is the number before 2
Is it over, tell me it isn't over
They told me it was easy as I get a little older, yeah right
And this is what my life outro sound like
Even though Dre did it this shit don't sound right
I was, born to do it, born to make bomb music
I flow tight like I was born Jewish
Well, actually I was born Jewish
I guess at this point you could say I was born foolish(ha)
Yea, what about the grammy's and the bubbly
What about all my fans that be loving me,I
Used to chill in them spots where the trouble be
But never ended up in that menage at the Double Tree
What about that girl Rita down in Basque
In L.A Swear I would of never cheated on your ass
But you ain't give me yo number cause them niggas got to fighting
Situation got me thinking and that's when I got to writing, hmm...
Change these hundreds for me cashier
Cause I ain't made it but I'm better off than last year, yeah
And what it look like hun'
I never got to make it rain but it look like fun
And, uh, a king is what I'm fit to be
I don't get these niggas, they a mystery
I mean they talk so quiet as if it its private
And they don't ever bring that shit to me, but
Man I ain't live life so wrong
I said fuck a couple dudes, cause I ain't like yo song
Least let me tell you why I'm this way
Hold on...I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still


Responsible for everything you listen to
While mediocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to;
Started poppin' bottles cuz it's ATL tradtion to
Celebrate at Bymark, fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin' and these bitches want a snow blow
And they just give me head while the haters give me promo
Hey man, my DJ shoulda won that
Well listen and respect,man the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko, party with Azuka
Shout goes out to wonder, shout goes out to future
Shout goes out to Getty
Motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
Cuz I see the flame flickerin'
Ex-girls bickerin'
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickerin
Tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'd take a minute if you're listenin'
Please start doin' you, I been doin' me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody even if you're suin' me
My brother P-Rain knows
We fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy
Please do not harass me
Just holla if you got me and fuck you if you had me
Shout out to Brian E,shout out to Photo Will
Shout out toOliverand40, man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to P-Plus
The names I mention are crucial; you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes
I could sacrifice a line like (mumbles)
Yeah, haha, I swear I really fuckin' does it
I had these niggas trippin', no luggage

Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time it’s all better, ‘cause time heal whatever

Cars with cream leather,females are on regular

I’d rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
Now ready,Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah

And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know

Ain't nobody like you
Heard you got a ballplayer
But he don't excite you
I ain't the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Still a superfreak
You know how I be when I'm rolling in the streets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Ginuwine cause I'm the same Ol' G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies, arguing in Barney's, fly shit
Too much pride to say sorry
Shit, problems running like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave but she wanna stay
She like "how you feeling babe?"
Like, shit

Yeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
It's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO!Southern Smoke!!!


Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit,they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin',can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
Andhe got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, andme, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But


I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!


This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a "nigga"
'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist




Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of starin' at quizzes now it'smodels with breasts
And yes,when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could of been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I don't wanna questionhalf the places Nick been

I'm a rapper turned singer, and you can tell that he smoke
But I don't need my vocal chords,all I hit is c-notes
N.E.R.D. flow, I spaz if I'm prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin' game, pass the remote
Money is everything, and it's every other thing
I'm part of the choir, that's the motto that my brother sing
Cash is the right now, women are post game
MoneyOverBitches.com, check the domain
It's comin' too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say, "Yeah, once in a blue moon"
Oops I mean a red moon, I did it again Tune
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation
I state heavy metaphors, flow so overweight
I could rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake
Frostbite Drizzy, nigga, nobody as cold as Drake
Keep your ass in line, don't be tryna to roller skate
Fuck all the discrete shit, I get on some deep shit
I am 21, tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you could tell I'm real
Cause I'm gettin' hood love and I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young angel, young lion, I'm done tryin'
I'm just doin',who's drinkin'? cause I'm buyin'
It's on me, everything is on me
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin' John B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listened back and now I'm sounded like a trumpet
This for all the strippers cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell 'em back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it
Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back and forth faxes
My money come in full circle, get up on my axis
MaybeI'm a kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm bein' cocky, but I'm only bein' honest
I'm swallowin' the Goose, got a model gettin' loose
And I never party 'less I got some bottles and a booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this
I'm just havin' patience, cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee State shit
Drop a 4 in it and appreciate the greatness
Drizzy


P-p-pass the dro
I am such a beast and you can ask them hoes
And they might even say you should leave me alone
And homie scared, cause his bitch like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy, I tote that boom-bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I ain't talkin' marbles, you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm fallin', but up I fall
And if your bitch in heat, she could fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin' to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter-Carter, ball harder
Ten girls, pent house suite, ya'll order
Whatever ya'll please: wine, crackers, and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my T's
The supplement I've taken got me feelin' mighty
My gun and money don't split, call that shit Siamese
Yes, my watch make the frickin' time freeze
Your girl bless me, she suck my dick and I sneeze
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And 18 G's is why the chicken crossed the street
Whatcha know 'bout it? my niggas so bout it
If you kill everybody, they can't go to court about it
Weezy, I ignore the liars baby I ignite the fire
I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy obviously,pop one at your Ivy Leage
I don't have a rivalry, if so you'll have a casueulty
Oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophe
Oops I meant actually,you niggas is just ass to me
And big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying
Or I hang you on the wall like a art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money
I got Cash Money, I got Young Money, bitchIt's 10 O'clock on a Wednesday and I know your home
Drivin up and down your street
Hopin that you'll come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me
Childish as it seems, it'll make it all better, better
Selfish as it is, this just ain't about you no
Did me wrong every time we were together
And that's why
I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could've made it all on my ownI want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes,I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful


Aw yeah,Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothing realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of ya'll are still sounding like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts,dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's coming, I just hope that I'm alive for it


I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes,I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful


Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been going sideways
And my mother try to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soaking wet, she only 5'2"
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hoping I never have to fit in
So try to keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is looking like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though cause I want the:


I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes,I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful


Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treading water, steady trying to swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me "Shopping Bag Drizzy"
Or call me Mr. "Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?"
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this young'n that you doubted is about to get busy
I'mma kill it, I promise,that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much, all I want is the


I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes,I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful


Pardon the swag, but bitch it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake,how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'mma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier then our shit
And that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha,ain't that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell "God"
Weezy Baby,I go re-al hard
No further details, boyPart of me wish that I could meet with all you haters in person
They got a lot of feelings for me they just ain't certain
How to express themself when I walk into the club
And take stares like the fuckin elevators ain't workin
Yea
Cuz they know the promoter paid you
You wouldn’t have come if someone hadn’t of made you
You just lookin forward to seein woman that played you
And shittin on the men they get engaged to
I swear it’s like
Uh
More confidence and less fear
We can discuss it further when yall manage to get here
Diddy here, o here, skinny here, rex here
And we just havin one of those conversations about next year
Ima kill it I promise this I know you mad
Ive always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much all I want is theOh yeah Trey, I f*ckin' feel ya
They be staring at the money like its unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me theres nothing realer
Just enough will solve ya problems, too much will kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of ya'll is still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the muthaf*ckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed, quarters of the k*sh in the lines of my head
Take my verses to serious you hate me
Cause' I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no hd
I want it all thats why I strive for it
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award will show a party, you know I get fly for it
I know its comin', I just hope I'm alive for it




I want the money, money, money, I wanna' whole lot of that
Cause' all the honeys, they ask me where them dollas at
Where yo head at? Tell me bout' your scholar cap
Tryna find a way, but you never found a map
Dream chaser, risk taker, no favor, no haters
I want things to go my way, but as of later lot of sh*t been going sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car, so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soaking wet, she only 5"2
And 48 hours all before I showed up, brought $1000 worth of drinks and got pulled up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the phantoms least them h**s wanna to get in
I do a lot of things hoping I never had to fit in
So tryna keep up with my programs is like a dead end
My girl love me but f*ck it, my heart beat slow
And right now, the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week so its good
But I know this ain't the peak doe cause'

Part of me wished I can meet with
All you haters in person,they got a lot of
Feelings for me they just ain't certain.How to
Express themselves when I walk into the club and
Take stares like the fuckin elevators ain workin
Yeah. Cause they know the promoter pays you, you wouldn't
Have come if somebody hadn't of made you, you just looking
Forward to seeing women that played you and shitting
On the men they get engaged to, I swear it's like. Uh
More confidence and less fear. We can discuss it further
When y'all manage to get here. Diddy here, O here
Skinny here, Rex here and we just having one of them conversations
About next year. I`ma kill it, I promise that`s how I know you
Mad. I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads. The
Big homie use a flash if you must and I swear I ain't asking
For much, all I want is the


I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful


Hip-hop is like school, yeah I had to
Learn it.Beef is like a blank disc, yeah
I had to burn it.They finally showing me
Respect but I had to earn it. I'm heading to
The finishing line, ain't got no time for
U-turns.Today I realise that I'm not perfect
Everything I did to get here wasn't really worth it
Why won't they just let me be great. You fall down seven
Times you stand up eight. Realise true happiness lies
Inside of you. Everyday give yourself a mental shampoo
The birds singing after the motherfukin` storm gone. If you
Want to sing, you can always sing this song. Turn my swag
On, this my theme song,there`s 95 per-cent chance that I used to
Be your ringtone.I got swissel and cheese but I don't yodel
Heart tatted on my neck they love my vocal




As I sit back and spit this crack and leaking
On the internet and watch my haters react
50 said they can't read between the lines so
I jab, uppercut, punchline after punchline
I know you thinking damn Soulja going hard
Right now. And I'm thinking damn this is just the
Start right now. Soulja Boy is going on a renegade
Uh, no one person on this earth can change their past
But every single person on this earth can start today
And change their future.That`s real shit. Beezy
Soulja Boy I tell 'emI want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful


Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothing realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of ya'll are still sounding like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's coming, I just hope that I'm alive for it


I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Yeah! I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Man, I hope---I just hope it's not too stressful
Revel, bask in the glory
I wanna be the next big thing and tell my story
Except whips and chains don't mean nothin'
All I need is to be with my girl who loves me
This is my time: be right, live exceptionally
This is my interpretation of livin' successfully
Count my blessings every night
Man, I hold my baby extra tight
Throughout life, she's the one who always treats me right
Destiny is what I'm gonna do
Successfully is my how-to
Failed at a lot, but got so much potential
This is a comeback: I'm just tryn'a be successful
And all I have to say is...


I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

DJ DOO-BAY: I do believe I've finished
BLACK SMITH: Yeah! Good job
DJ DOO-BAY: Hopefully!
KREATIVE TENDENCIES: This is another edition of Austin not giving a **fuck** about shit! Why? Because I'm a pre-med student. A microbiology pre-med student, and I'm stressed all the goddamn time, and this is the only way I can get the stress out! And don't say start smoking, cause I've already tried that. It don't help
BLACK SMITH: Hahaha, it does not!
KREATIVE TENDENCIES: Cause it just stresses me out more when I come down from the high because then I be lookin' for somethin' to eat and ain't shit to eat!!!
DJ DOO-BAY: "And then I get more pissed off!"
KREATIVE TENDENCIES: And if you've never seen me, I'm a big dude... I gotta eat!!!


Cheah!Iced out wrist,yeahmodel-type chick
Fast car,shopping sprees,nigga;out of country check
Got Vuitton on my belt,Kenneth Cole on my feet
Is this really what success supposed to be?
I mean, I mean, I want the
(Money...) Biiiiiiiiiiitch! (Cars...Clothes...)
Biiiiiiiiiiitch! (The hoes...) I suppose
To make me more, then is this really what I need?
I suppose if this what I need, I gotta get it
I wanna be successful! (Successful...successful...)


I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful


Yeah! I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Man, I hope---I just hope it's not too stressful...

Yeah, I want the clothes, cars, cash and the hoes
And I bet I'll get it all off the backs of my flows
Hate can't douse my fire, not even with a hose
But that blouse I see that devil in is definitely hittin' close
To the home that holds my heart---it's throwin' me off guard
This threat to my security could tear my life apart
A part of me is comfy, the other side is dark
Got me questioning my loyalties 'fore I even make my start
See, what's relative to royalty is never under feet
But what's relevant to honesty is always my defeat
Now it's got me wonderin' whether not I belong up on this beat
Cause all these raps about rims got me more tired than the street
So I spill my heart and soul on top of instruments instead
And tell Fatigue "fuck off" as I attempt to stay ahead
Cause brain will draw the ear even at the expense of rest
And my pen and pad connection are my own ingredients to bread
I want it all!...


I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successfulI’m not that good with words, but I’m a try my best
Look, I don’t wanna ever make you mad girl
I just wanna have you see you know the things young men are hesitant to have girl
A little you a little me and someone else, good lord that’s a winner right there
But we really got a story to tell, it can’t finish right there
I used to wonder what my old girl doing right now
Ever since you came into my life
Everytime I think it’d be good to call her
I just think about you and it’d make me think twice, ah yeah
Yeah, I know we’ve been through a couple things
You know a couple things, what are we to do
But you make me feel good, cause you love me for me and you love me for you
Come on


You’re, making it feel that everything is alright (it’s gon be alright)
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower
You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower[Drake Talking]:
Yeah

Ahhhhhh

Walk into a room and you can smell the Clive Cristian scent
Alot of niggas is threatned by my positioning
Thrillin bars you think I'm writing with John Ghrisam
Pen

Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom no license
Fuck if you're feelin me as long as your wife is
No one in my city gotta pocket like Drizzy
I can rock fitted Jeans cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidentials
And Ms. Rhone sorry you ain't notice my potential
Fuck ya rappers and your self-proclaimed status
I can only see green now happy St.Patty's
I know you waitin on a last quote
Check the soundscan and you can see that I'm the last hope

[Verse 2]:
By the way I'm Jewish and turnin 22
Get's depressing when you see your favorite rappers
Goin through it
Tryna re-invent themselves, showin' no improvement
Gettin' crushed by this light skinned young'n on some
New shit
40 just recorded and who dropped this here
Cos I'm tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
And you are in my age bracket, you are not my peer
Fuck you really know about a Eames couch
Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake, but a nigga's livin' ya dreams out
Lookin like a photoshoot everytime the team's out
And is the realest nigga still I
A woman could love me to death but I'd still die
So I'm about us now
Smith and Wesson flow

She keep giving me looks (oh-oh-oh)
She keep giving me looks (oh-oh-oh)
She keep giving me looks
I need you right here beside me
If you oblige me, I'll hang it up, and I'll never come out of retirement
You should just sleep on it, you shouldn't doubt me
It would be different without me
What is it without me
Don't go do nothing without me
This is a blessing, mashallah, wallahi
I swear my life stories better than stories they tellin' bout me
They got it twisted
Ride the pipe like a bike, make sure you're going the distance
And if he wasn't with it, then why were you with him?
Maybe you just had to realize
That  knowing the difference can make all the difference
She wanna ride me that adanunana
Yeah she keep giving me looksI couldn't resist (I couldn't resist)

(These niggas be mad now)

Forever I’m King and my bitch she be Queen
And she know I got D for her
Imma be me till I leave
Tell her hold that, this game gon cost some fee
Swishin’ I swish , what it’s like to be me
Swiping I swipe, mother fuck being cheap
I got kush in my wallet I'm zoned by the weed
Never gon stop and I put that on me
Conquered my craft now I’m stuck on repeat
I got to eat till my pockets obese


These niggas be mad now
(These niggas be mad when you make it (x2))
These bitches be mad now
(These bitches be mad when you make it(x2))
They full on that jealousy


I couldn't resist (I couldn't resist)
I mean look at that bitch
She looked at my wrist and she couldn´t resist
Back to back one, pop a bottle how could you resist
Pull up like Jordan
I'm ballin', whenever I shoot it goes swish


Roll up another one
Pull me another one
I want another one
Every time that I take a shot I swear I never miss
I love it, I’m winnin', I’m feenin the game
Ain’t got no assists


I’m on a whole different level
I need me a whole different bedroom
When you don’t got it boy how can you sell it
Always on go, my foot down on the pedal
Spending my money that shit just keep flowing
She popped her some pills now that bitch is just rolling
Roll up another one we just keep going
I hope that she ride me the same in the morning


I couldn't resist (I couldn't resist)
I mean look at that bitch
She looked at my wrist and she couldn´t resist
Back to back one, pop a bottle how could you resist
Pull up like Jordan
I'm ballin', whenever I shoot it goes swish


Roll up another one
Pull me another one
I want another one
Every time that I take a shot I swear I never miss
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost


I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know
They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still,tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakesso look me in my eyes




It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do...you do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you.. instead they say:


(Intro)
Drake Talking/ad-libing:
Its Young Money Baby
I got something for these niggas to ride to
Fa'sho
Here I go

Verse 1:
Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now
Su-woop to the bangers
Su-woop to the bangers, (yeah)
And I say, I be on some G shit
I be on some G shit
Check out what I done, and
Check out who I be with
Im me bitch, I said I'm me bitch

Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG
---Guitar Break---

Verse 2:
Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love
Cuz I don't have the time for that

Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where its at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggas for that Louisshopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

---Guitar Break/Breakdown/Solo---

Outro Verse
I a'int have sex in a long time x3
Are we havin is sex tonight?
Ladies say, I ain't have sex in a long time
I a'int have sex in a long ass time
Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight

Let me do me, you just do you
Im double cupped right now
Su-woop to the (whoa oh oh ohh)Me and you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
Cause mines it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like


You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go

Man, you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
And love, I don't mind feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm in the fresh and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
Cause mines it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like


You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would


Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl


Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you


Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
And now they like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined"
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
Cause the fabrication would help to settle that
And imagination would ease the pain
I came into this world as honest and pure
But can't guarantee to you that I'mma leave the same, so


Yeah
Rich Homie Quan
(Reps Up, OVO)
Rich Homie Quan
(You already...)


All my niggas so hungry, man they just eat what they kill
I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit
And like you just got traded
Girl you don't know who you're playin' with
Oh yeah, oh yeah, my sound is what up right now
I've been down, but I'm up right now
Nigga been backstrokin' and breaststrokin'
Through that lane that you left open
Man I don't give a fuck right now
Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low
'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla


Started from the bottom like Drake said
You the type of nigga get robbed wanna play dead
My squad'll  kick in your door where that safe at
No Atari, games girl I don't play that
If she broke I don’t acknowledge her, everything I say I follow up
What you talkin' 'bout? Ummmm, Polo shirt, my collar up
Drippin' on these hoes
Ain't by myself, it's a lot of us
Made a little money, still ain't got enough
And if you got a nigga dead, put your lighter up
Eyes open, don't say nothin'
Motor geeked up like a razor
You don't know me, you must mistake me
For somebody else
But it's somethin' about you that I fell in love with
Your ex nigga, fuck him
I had to tell her that




Question, baby, tell me why
One question, baby, tell me whyYeah, the ball is in your court
No defense, nobody's keeping score
No offense but I've played this before
Maybe you can and you just don't care anymore
Evolving, evolving, evolving, e-yeah
And I’m right back here when I said I wouldn't
You were never a good girl but you're a better woman now
Evolving, evolving, evolving, evolving
Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin
Your body insane in person
Wanna do special things for you
You deserve it
But you're too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
This time is different, you give me purpose
Tell me you taking it serious
I gotta ask how serious?
Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like I'm not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy that's thrown at me
Been thinking 'bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley
And Niks has Ezee
And I, I don’t even know what I have anymore
Evolving, evolving, evolving, evolving


We are not the same I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And they're about to call the wrong attention
And I ain't got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessing
XO niggas ain't nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no we're destined
And everybody around you is so basic
I'm never rocking white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'
And money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Give me head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it


Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I did it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill


Last year I did all the politicin'
This year I'm all focused on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixing
I'm talking about the ones from the beginning
Don't believe the rumours bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rocking camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killing
I'mma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin, everybody fucking
Pussy on the house, everybody fucking
And I miss my city man it's been a minute
M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Driving by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle


Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill


My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
It's only meant to fall in love
That shit is pointless


You could thank me now, go ahead
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now


Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential,I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who would have thought the route we'd chosen would ever end up the scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time that your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike but got to AI him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
That's how you know it's going down in case another chance never comes around




Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allowed,where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position

Nuh ShakeHope you see
It won't mean a thing to me
I've been doing this too long
Baby girl, I've felt it all
So watch out
If you try to play your luck
Ain't nobody gonna care enough
To catch you fall


So don't you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Nobody needs to fall in love
I swear I'm just a bird
Girl, I'm just another bird
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me


You tried
You tried to warn me
But baby, I'm warning you
Girl, I'll show you
This is no game
You'll be falling to the point of no return
No return


So don't you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me
Cause girl I'm just a bird
I'm just another bird
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Nobody needs to fall in love


I know you're rolling hard with it, don't lie
I know it's got a hold of you
I know you're rolling with it
Baby, don't you lie


So don't you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me
Cause girl I'm just a bird
I'm just another bird
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like meI'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget them and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swearmy word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't



You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position vent to y'all but
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwyane
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone try not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in Memphis Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a slang
Call me "Heartbreak Drake",I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest; as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yea, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me


I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
And everybody wanna ask
What type of act you putting on, like
ManWe walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
—Drake, Right Above It

Many years ago, I encountered a particularly tricky management situation. Two excellent organizations in the company, Customer Support and Sales Engineering, went to war with each other. The Sales Engineers escalated a series of blistering complaints arguing that the Customer Support team did not respond with urgency, refused to fix issues in the product, and generally inhibited sales and customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, the Customer Support group claimed that the sales engineers submitted bugs without qualification, did not listen to valid suggested fixes, and were alarmists who assigned every issue the top priority. Beyond the actual complaints, the teams genuinely did not like each other. To make matters worse, these groups had to work together constantly in order for the company to function. Both teams boasted superb personnel and outstanding managers, so there was nobody to fire or demote. I could not figure out what to do

During this time, I miraculously happened to watch the motion picture classic Freaky Friday starring the underrated Barbara Harris and the incomparable Jodie Foster—note: there is also a high quality remake starring Jamie Lee Curtis and the troubled, but talented Lindsey Lohan. In the film, mother and daughter grow completely frustrated with each other’s lack of understanding and wish that they could switch places and they do:

Through the course of the movie, by being inside each other’s bodies, both characters develop an excellent understanding of the challenges that the other faces. As a result, the two women become great friends when they switch back. After watching both the original and the remake, I knew that I had found the answer: I would employ a Freaky Friday management technique

The very next day I informed the head of Sales Engineering and the head of Customer Support that they would be switching jobs. I explained that, like Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris, they would keep their minds, but get new bodies. Permanently. Their initial reactions were not unlike the remake:

However, after just one week walking in the other’s moccasins, both executives quickly diagnosed the core issues causing the conflict. They then swiftly acted to implement a simple set of processes that cleared up the combat and got the teams working harmoniously. From that day to the day we sold the company, the sales engineering and support organizations worked better together than any other major groups in the company—all thanks to Freaky Friday, perhaps the most insightful management training film ever madeFor niggas with hate I got llamas
Tissues for they mama
I'm flyer than Aladdin on a carpet
Saw A Whole New World when I made my profits
And my jasmine is a rapping
I do it the best, These niggas ain't smashing
Raw dog action
I impregenate the beat everytime I speak
A seed of my speech concives and MC!(Ho!)
Similar to me( yes),so we ain't' got to write just think
Keep it in the head like T
Spit listerine on the beat
Flossin' diamonds and me
Now peep the way I deliver on the beat
Is what you lack yeah that's why I'm so SWEET!
That's why yo chick want to pump me (right)
She want to be the chick from the other guy
Wanna be a lover I chuckle I laugh
As soon as you turn yo back I'm smashing
Hey I'm the other guy
Now you wanna rumble why
I mixed some limbs up make you a jambalaya
Wet you up
Roll you down the mountain and let your tumble drop
Throwback line for those who been listening (Uh!)
For all the new listeners that boy just filling
Niceklus is gifted nickename his Christmas
Make up a wishlish
Cop yall CD at this point I bet yall get it
At this point forget it..
I'm like a preganat woman I deliver
Now pop it push it!




(I gotta spill on this)
That's why I roll up and tend to get high
Cause my arms won't extend to the sky
Peer pressure always make me feel lesser than a 10 in they eyes
So I can only grab my pen and advise
Street legends and chicks seem to wonder
Exaclty who I am
You know me if you had a job at 16 and under yup
It'sDrake and Saint Nick
Take a whiff of this and faint quick
Off a sample of the flow patient
But I don't lie to rymers
I strip walls and apply the primer
If there's it's a wall I'm gone try to climb-aaa
Without a grader or a navy seal
But these yellow slurs I'm gone always find another way
I'm minty fresh with the Green like I'm made a bathing scope
No bathing ape but I'm clean Like I'm made of soap
Begging for the fire
Buglars in hear we
We all good in the fam we like Meagan and limiya
I dress like Lou,I sell verses to label
And they give methe next join
To sound less like you
That's something I had to say before
I'm real picky with real with lyrics
I dont' use joints you probably would pay me for
I ain't' a heat busser
What up to Denik Rusha and Bei Major,Trey Songz, the street's Usher
Leak tracks and heat wax and he bust ya
And then sign ya
This is a reminder
This along the lines of Thriller Gone still the song
I'mma mention Jay even though I feel it's wrong
We gave good ambition homegirl couldn't listen
Now she want the snapback back and
Bring the topic back
Please don't stop the track
Never drop the hammer but
Mixtapes where I top em at
DJ Smallz.com you can shop at that
Speak of shopping I'm tryna get a label deal
Tryna live dreams wide awake make the fables will
No stealing cable trying to have my cable still
Better yet stolen, my grammer is golden
My grammer go harder than most rappers
There's a certain female rapper exposing
For once I think you should tell yo mouth to get to closing
No I didn't pen that Freestyle shit
I got a session with Digs so the beef I'm gone end that
Anybody get the piece that I been back
Let it marinate if you niggas dare to hateI don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statements just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga
That's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna,you know it


Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh, well
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"


I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna, you know it


Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh, well
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"


Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines,big time
Sunshine,tote nines,bust mines
Flatline, hard grind,high life
Stay fly it's jet time,stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga, stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga, stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga, stunt niggaI gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope.Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope


Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dotmotherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to successin the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher then leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall




Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drakeand I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

Hm Hm Hm
Don’t wanna be rude
But hey girl I’m just sayin’
You should be with some other dude
Quit all of these games you playin’
Trust me I’m the one for you
At least for the time bein’
Though I love how you do
Promise I won’t be misbehavin’
Yeah so if you wanna go with me
Well you gotta know baby
Every time I see you at the club you gettin’ low baby
And I ain’t askin’ outright
I was just thinkin’ maybe
We would hit it off all right
Can I hit you up tonight?



What is all of this noise that I hear
Sounds like a bunch of animals running in fear
Do any of y'all know what you talkin about
Or are these just meaningless screams and shouts
Guns, gangs, gold teeth and chains/
All your psychobabble talk makes me insane
Each and everyone of you is out of luck
I think all of you suck
Not one of you is worth a buck
Worthless as a Ford pickup truck
Found on the road dead
You all need to go home, go to bed
Fenixpunk, you stink like mildewed spunk
S.B., I don’t know what to say
I think maybe you’re the one that’s gay
Hobo Jesus, what’s in the name
Hobo the clown fits better, your broke and lame

Nigga don't worry

I live in LA
Where y'all get the money
But my mama taught me not to jump things
She told me I don't get street style
Put the beats together, put it in a pile
At the recording studio
Mixed the hot jam with the fucking radio
Biiiiitch.....
Fuck off and unleash the leeeeeeeash...It's Eastwing, we in this b*tch
Wish a pit would like a dog in this b*tch
And if her ass growl nother breed in that b*tch
I smell like BO add Degree to that shit
I'm f*cked up, worn down
Got twisted, tight bound
Talk stupid, he ate the bread
Nigga money talks like Mr. Lett
My lung so rusty got a plum from the sun
Fertilizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't sh*t sweet niggas on the street eatin boogers
Lung almost touched my toungue
Skeet skeet skeet other lung
Oh my god Freddy, look at her butt saggy


Now she goin loco
You already know though
You only win once: that's the motto nigga YOWO
We bout it everyday, everyday, everday
It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion


I don't have a fuck to give,I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from your man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah


Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion


Yeah, looking back on it at least my pride is intact
Cause we said no strings attached and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah


She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion


Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
Talking to you is not enough
I guess that’s just the motionI'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they know ya

It's Jorge, back-to-back with Aubrey
And white chicks, dying to back their asses on me
But, I ain't referring to "white-girl booty," niggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Her ass looking like a bag o' laundry
The b*tch a milf; I'm f*cking her with her man's pops
"Charlie Horse" dick's tenderizing her lamb chops
Started off soaked, shorty had the damp twat
Till I hit it all night and left her with a sand box
That's why I'm rarely home. You know a brother busy
Plus, I'm outta town, promoting "... The Wunderwizzy"
But in each and every one of my cities
I've got a wonderful biddy with a couple of double-D titties
You feel me? Life is pretty. You tight cause yours is sh*tty?
Well, don't get it twizzy; my background: gritty
Team Zeta 'bout the paper; the neighbors caught the vapors
Before you try and play us, though, go and get a shape-up, hater

Tell Uncle LukeI'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


One...time? Fuck one time
T-raw, skinny nigga big balls
Fuck around and get Drag. Ru Paul
You funny little nigga Duval
Out of this world Total Recall
Call a bitch ride dick like her see saw
Sorta like a donkey, act a ass nigga hee-haw
Ridin round in the ‘rarri wit the top off
While you in the window, man I’m probably on my next car
Aight,Mighty duck with the ice on
Real L.A. nigga chucks with the gun drawn
Drawing on your face you’re a clown jack in the box
Boy that’s your bop, she my new pum pum star
Stars in the back
Them my homies, they don’t act, acting brand new
Fuck her never call her back
Matt Forte got the bitch running back
Damn, That’s the motto you don’t know it’s like that

Back it on up, baby girl, get low
I'mma double your money, better buy you some blow
When the choppers come out, the fuck niggas get low
Ask them who they riding with, them real niggas say, "Snow"
That's how you feeling, that's how you feeling, that's how you feeling
Album just dropped, I should do it by the millions
Told my downstairs neighbor I'm bout to buy the whole building
Like Club Amnesia, I'll remove the whole ceiling
While your bitch looking over here like she want something
My partner's so high, looking like he on something
Johnson &amp; Johnson, got the kitchen full of powder
We ain't playing around here, we take choppers in the shower
One hand on the trigger, other hand on the soap
Big gold medallion, call it swag on a rope
Shooters on call all day like CERTs
We at you pussy niggas all day like virgins
K.O.D., we heard you ran out ones
Missed the whole club, must have ran out of funds
Twos on deck, the ones in the air
Blonde laced fronts, ones all in the air
Snowing gears, popping bottles like them niggas won something
Young going in, ain't even won something
The bitch you got with you so fine, I might tip her
Say she work at Macy's, got a body like a stripper, what's up?


Say she want a photo, you already know though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sitting on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see em cause the money in the way, real nigga what's up?


Gangster Gibbs, ho, I'm never scared
Flip seven things, go and get a 7 Series
Shorty hit me with that neck when it's necessary
Ciroc-ed out, coconut, she on the red berry
Panamera photo, but you already know though
Couple hundred niggas, Corporate Thuggin' be the logo
Got my chopper from a Cuban and my 'caine from a cholo
Me and Young be the rap game Tony and Manolo
What's up? Nino and G Money
I blood with them B's and C'sfrom D-Money
A nigga used to fuck with that barely-could-eat money
Now I got that Massu Missa, Nobu, Phillipe money,what's up?
What you know about that pussy on the Perignon
Thug nigga, keep the kush up in his carry-on
Birds for the thirty-three, I got my Larry on
Where the thong at? Freddie home; real nigga, what's up?

Them other girl you done been wit
None of 'em got nothin on me
Ain't got my style, they ain't got
NOTHIN on me~! NOTHIN on me~!
Way I walk, way I talk, my swagga
Look around, every dude wanna have her
I ain't sayin that I'm the best, but I'm the best
Hey baby, you need that


Lemme break it down if you don't get it
Quality, I'm custom fitted
I'mma say it again, they ain't got
NOTHIN on me~! NOTHIN on me~! {ONE}
Way I walk, way I talk, my swagga
Boy, you know every boss wanna have her
I ain't sayin that I'm the best, but I'm the best
Hey baby, you need that




UH-OHHHHHH
Okay, I got these girls quite hype
Only thing on right now like a nightlight
While my brother Wayne rockin' out like a White Stripe
I'mma kill the game, I'm the Young Money white knight
Yeah, plus I'm lookin for the right type
Cautious of a flood so I always lay the right pipe
Wes put me on the marquee flight life
Plus I go hard for the woman that I might wife
I put the ring on her index finger
So if you wanna keep ya girl please don't bring her
I bet I'm the type of guy that she got a thing for
And you would block me, but this ain't Jenga
Yeah, and she's someone I would work with
That's what I can tell from what she's showin' on the surface
I ain't sayin I'm requestin' anyone that's perfect
But I just need a woman that'll make it all worth it




Na-na-na-na-nah...
Na-na-na-na-na-na-nah..
It's that na-na-na-na-naaaaah..
It's that na-na-na-ba-naaah...
I'm the one-one-eno-on-{ONE}
I'm the one-(eno)-one-(eno)-one
(Oh, y'all ain't ready of this one)
(Y'all ain't ready for this one!)
I'm the one-one-one-one-one
WHOOOOOOOO~! Another one, Rodney
That's girl's number one, finally standing up for herself sayin...
She's the oneShake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
And homie, you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you, I got enough clout for two
And like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
They like, "Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?"
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
I'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways

Cause I need drug money
Who got drug money?
I am talkin "white Phantom sittin' on dub" money
I am talkin "cold champagne at the club" money
And no I ain't emotional, but baby I love money
To all these A&amp;R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb?
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum
I spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum
I fooled y'all, ain't shit for me to come back from


Oh!
Yes!
I'd like to take this opportunity to formally welcome you to this
Extravaganza that I call Comeback Season
Hope you enjoy your stay, drinks are on me by the way
Yeah


How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up before they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more Sess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes
I'm known in the city, but need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl if you don't like me
It's probably due to the fact that you are a les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus,I go, yeah
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid,get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise


People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekends here, started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing


Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down


But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time


They keep telling me don't save you,if I ignore all that advice
Then something isn't right, then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other


Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down


But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time


Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first,but it's better than your last..Tunechi


But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time


Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them "that ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabiesYesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited,there's noway to fight it
You can stay but shorty here I go


Should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
"It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!"
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough


What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"


Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on
Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit "redial", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread it's like I'm high right now
The guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now




I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I started treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen themsince they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's overI hate when people say they feel me man, I hate that shit
It’ll be a long time before yall feel me, if ever


You won’t feel me untileverybody
Say they love you, but it’s not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you orderedto forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend's ass keep getting thicker than a plot does
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit's right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It’s feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down, they just keep on
Saying that they feel you, nigga


I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride


You won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you’re in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503: some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga



I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I’m driving right up to it now
Make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas popping M’s and sipping dirty jones
Problem children that all be repping October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I’m bout to fuck and I’m just praying that it feels good
I really don’t know much but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my nigga don’t believe it
I mean, sure, there’s some bills and taxes I’m still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker,season ticketholder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches
Still scorching as if I didn’t notice
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda
I’m out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldn’t fuck with my freshman floater (flow ta)
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it
My juniors and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga

Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen
I go from records withDweleandL.B.andElzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy
Now I'm out inA-Town
They tellin' me Trey sound
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train
Dog, personally mane
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they Purpose is game
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game
I keep on, on, on, on, on


[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all


Yeah
Let me show you how to blast up
Now tell me who is a masta
A mind never wasted
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin' yo' ass up
You look a lil' red, we gettin' that cash up
See where we from
The 50's are bloody and the 100 dollar bill is dirty brownthey love Me
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of
My lapel, is custom made
You off the rack shit
I'm off the chain, come on

The dogs are loose
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay
With40andMac Dre
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk
Drake'll give you the deal
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill
Keep on, keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh)




Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda
Ol' time killin'
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin'
And now the girls like
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin'
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin'
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men
And  now whoever chose to back out is back in
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold
And keep on, on, on, on, on

Intro:

Verse (Trey Songz):
How 'bout we just pull over and do it where we at
How 'bout you just lift that skirt up, ooh we can be bad
That place that ain't been touched, I'm feelin on it
All that juicy fruit, keep spillin' on it
Girl, giddyup, get it up take me on a ride to extacy
You don't wanna pump pump then take a nap
You just wanna pump pump, bring it right back
Watch me (Watch me), Im'a heat it up beat it up

Hook:
Know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not coming with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon feel something unusual

Verse (Trey Songz):
I want to do the freaky things you never do
What if we did it while your friends was in the room
Is that too much for ya?
Don't you feel bad, let them see your sexy ass
We can make a sex room wherever we go

Watch me heat it up beat it up
Hey, do you hear me girl
Woah watch me heat it up beat it up

Hook:

In the jet (check), On the beach (leggo)

Rap (Drake):
This that other shit, You know your asked for it
I might just send you some money to get your passport
So you can come to my city, I'll take you all over
And hit you on the balcony just don't fall over
Send me your picture baby you know I'll never leak it
I know you got something recent for someone decent
Why you laughin' out loud, I'm serious
Bring your girl if she's a little bi-curious
Please, please no story tellin' to others
I promise you gon' love it
I would never let you down
Feel like I might have perfected all the things that you expected
You gon know it when you bring your ass around

Hook:

Outro:
Do it all different ways or different places
Look at the many love faces your makin'
But can you take it

Yall thought I was nasty last time...LeggoI’m performing tonight you know that shit gone be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that it’s exact
My ex girl’ll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trend setting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring your Mrs by me
I’m it I’m it call me Mr. IT
If I get one wish I'mma wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like Ms. Arie and I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
SoHo, Cosmo, bah mar blow fish
Let's make a toast, tell your friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster


We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner


Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It’s about time that you made it
I was bumping your songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beats in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can’t sign nothing til my lawyer get the factsand
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murray look at what my talent did
And what your business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it’s not about who you know
It’s just how you balance it
It’s always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you coming the hardest
It's how you start actin when nobody can reach you
My plan just hatched, happy easter




Uhh, ok I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in your starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A lot of people sayin fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck Ts
And I never trust a nigga saying trust me
Nick cannon and will never did it this ill
So you tell the house band don’t you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to Uncle Steve, my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us


And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn’t leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Sher
I’ll forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel I hope heaven’s prepared for whenever you there


I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through your stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motherfucking Mario
Yeah and Polo isn’t at my session
It’s the anticipation keeping everybody guessing like

Why you rushing me baby?
It’s only us, alone
I don't want to die tonight baby
So lemme sip this slow
I’ll give you what you called for
Just let me get in my zone
I’ll be making love to her through you
So let me keep my eyes closed


And I won't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'mma touch you right
I won't see a damn thing
I can’t feel a damn thing
But I’mma touch you right


And I'mma lean, till I fall, ooh yeah
And I don’t give a damn
I felt the ground before
I left it all behind, baby
I didn’t need no one
But I’m in heat tonight baby
I’ve been alone for too long
Oh, oh yeah


So, I won't say a damn thing
I can’t feel a damn thing
But I’ma touch you right
I can’t see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I’ma touch you right


I’mma touch you right (let me sip this slow)
I’mma touch you right (let me get inside my zone)
I’mma touch you right (just let me)


Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin’ artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail,got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's.. go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit yo sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That’s that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But its all good, don’t stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don’t really like attention, I don’t know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeahYeah, 9th Wonder!Don't judge me man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though


Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me


They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theoryis that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'mma take this hat off, and I'mma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping




You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping bout trapping you's a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned



They say you never judge a book by its cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
No El' will never judge a book by its cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

Look
In this world of desperate housewives andfreakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin' in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envyOmar
Because so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And that's somehigher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot
With the tires burnin'
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of sadey by spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Aleshia lately
I'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh

Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
Circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like Macgyver
Cause you sneakin' around
And she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple a years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls
Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh

Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

Check
And nowadays some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet
But there's logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinking she been spoiled
But golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it see
You take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing
Her reputation's in jeopardy
Cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
For thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is goneY'all know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need, she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
All-all-all-all-all-all we do is shop until we drop
(Just throw it in the bag, bag)
(x2)


You know we had to go shopping one more time, right?
I think we forget somethin, haha, haha
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I said if you gettin money, if you gettin money
If you gettin money, just throw it in the bag


It's Mr. "Throw It In The Bag",I just throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it cost but I know this bitch is bad
Walk up to that register like I ain't know it had a tag
I'm no liar I don't front, I'm a buy her what she want
Cause your queen 'posed to get what she desire, what she want
If my lady like to eat, then I'm a buy her restaurants
And she such a boss bitch, she can hire who she want
She can help me blow this green, she the fire to my blunt
You can try her if you want, bet it's gon' cost you
Bags with the G's,jeans with the horseshoe
She can go to work or chill like a boss do
That nigga ain't ya nigga unless he endorse you
They sayin it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't got to worry 'bout her she fine
My Player Card's approved, you niggas declined, NICEEE!!




If you gettin money, if you gettin money
If you gettin money, just throw it in the bag
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I said if you gettin money, if you gettin money
If you gettin money, just throw it in the bag


Well alright
Loso,and Drizzy baby

Uh uh, we up in Barneys goin dumb again
Every time we leave the manager say "come again"
Honestly she's probably old enough to be my mama friend
She just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again
If her card declined, you need to check that shit and run again
They don't give you limits when you keep that money comin in
Yeah, just fold some paper around the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car then she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband 'til she found out that he cheats
And then she filed for divorce and watch her bank account increase
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool
Her son is 26 but he just went away to school
She always show me pictures of him, tell me that's her baby
I hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaaazy
And I be spendin all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in '86
Yeah, she say she lucky that she his
No, I'm lucky that you mine baby, you know what it isssss






Shorty so nice, I don't mean polite
When I say nice, I mean lookin right
And you can't put a price on something lookin right
If they ask how much, tell em what it's lookin like
Everything I buy fly, it's like I'm bookin flights
If I want it, I'm a get it, that should not be tooken light
And that's on everything I got a crazy lady
So Money Ain't A Thang Jay-Z, J.D
Like Jay-Z's lady, it's Beyoncein
Supportin your women goes beyond payin
Watchin me ball is like LeBRON playin
I'm in the Louie shoes you might see KanYe in
They sayin it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't got to worry 'bout her she fine
My Player Card's approved, you niggas declined,NICEEE!!



Girl you’re so kind, I think you’re the best
You’re an angel not a devil when you’re in that blue dress
With the girls I find they always seem to fail my tests
Or rather I fail her tests cause I can’t do long-term like the rest
I’m a player I confess,it barely takes two secs
To get her to leave her ex within three hours we're near sex
With my hands I caress, her chest, her soft nice flesh
But at my age I can’t rest, only tension is a stress
Pretty girl in your bedroom, chilling out with no makeup on
That’s when you're the prettiest, girl please don’t take that wrong
But you will only trip if I went and brought R-Patz along
Kristen Stewart was holy fit, then those photos got snapped upon
I know I preyed upon those older girls, those out of this world
Now I’m going back down to Earth, fuck all the shit that’s stirred
I’m truly a find, I’m your fantasy in disguise
They say love is blind, girl you’d better close your eyes


Last Valentine’s Day I met a girl named Renee
We were in love by May, then she found out about April
So she chose to March, damn another broken heart
Don’t blame her, she can’t take a part, it’s my faultI say
Girl now you know all of my past relationships okay
Don’t act with me, you left that old cast on the ship today
Let’s take a holiday, to Las Vegas or LA
Or somewhere just to sit and watch boats by the bay
When you’re young your looks are such a blessing
But a curse, because a boy can’t look at you for five seconds
You’ll just feel insecure,I’m so sure
But that fear can be cured, cause girl I’m the cure
That's my lure,the man who don't do killing
Except lyrically, but personally is just into romantic feelings
Baby tell me your inner thoughts and your deepest emotions
The next thing you see is an ecstasy explosion


Call me crazy shit at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get rightAnd I roll up looking harder than a....bitch!
Damn a nigga never switch
You should get your cherry bust
Before you fuck around with this!
I buy some Rolexes and pass em out as gifts
And when they tell me that's too much
I'm like "no, fuck it, I insist!"
And then we light it up and reminisce
About the things that we would fix
How the fuck we got this rich?
This is just some inspiration
For young niggas on they shit!
This for my young niggas on they shit for real
This also for the hood stars that I created
Whose booking rate went up right after we dated
Girl you made it for real
Hosting parties with athletes or another rapper
Then they trying to fuck you after
Remember when you was my....bitch!?
My special friend with benefits
You remember how you got here?
Hope to God you ain't forget..
But the look you're giving me tells me you did
Empty stares across the club
Like y'all don't recognize the kid
But damn.. you know what it is
Cameras flashing over here, I know that's something
That you miss, yeah
It been bad, and it gets good
Drizzy Drake and the nigga Tim WestwoodFucking cockroaches
Muthafuckin’ Freebandz
Want me to be the bad guy?
Wanna fuckin play?
Cartel nigga


Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ends
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana


I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east, where niggas split your cantaloupe
You tell me where you wanna meet, I’m coming with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud,I’m laced up to the fucking fo’
A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, dropping all cash
Gutter to the death of me, I’m sticking to the recipe
Plugged in with Colombians, I know Sosa
All I got is my balls and my word,fuck the roaches
Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofas
The money got me geeked like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie,I gotta stay focused




On the hood you see the Stallion,passenger a stallion
Niggas getting nervous, I’m passing out the Valium
I suggest you pop it,but please don’t get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkingup in400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes’ll see me, be like that's how you feeling
Used to stay up at The Twelve,now your worth like 12 million
Boy you did, boy you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fucking women that knew Biggie so it really ain't no biggie
It’s just OVO and XO,and freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto, bitch, I’m Tony in my city




Another shot of Quelo, she'll be coming back to pesos
When your blood is your Pedro, it’s hard for hoes to let go
See AK’s ain't no bitch, nigga, I’ll split your tato
Ain’t nothing about me ordinary,I come with the yayo
I move like a mob boss,it’s gonna take an army
The world is mine,nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin with me, you’ll move to Alaska by the morning
You want me to be the bad guy?Okay, it's on then
Champagne spilling, crab cakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin', she say I ain't playing fair
I’m about to cop a tiger, and put it in the car seat
Freebandz a company,so nigga it don't matter, ayeDon't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you


Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it,like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"



Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down




Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'And in the Caribbean twistin' off Corona tops
I'm sittin' down hittin' half court floater shot
Bitches takin' pictures because every night's a photo op
Yeah, and nothing has been photo shopped
I say I'mma buy the bar and they say nigga no you're not
I be satisfied with the percentage that my lawyer got
Makin' other people rich is something I enjoy alot
Uh, can you tell even when your girl won't
I'mma still be feelin' me even when the world don't
Shit just changed forever first I get a lot of dough
Then I end up with your woman that's just how it's gotta go
Yeah, and I can tell her things and treat her right
You can get whatever baby remember you and me tonight
Throw the pussy at me guarantee that you won't see a strike
I'mma hit it hard you gon' think you Derek Jeter wife
Uh, tell me, how does that sound?
I can get it ass up and with your back down
Spit that all suki suki in your ear
It's the nigga Rich Boy and the rookie of the yearDrizzy, we here, we in the buildin

Lay go...

Drake

Who else really tryna fuck with Hollywood shows
I’m with Marley G ho
Fly hardly grown chicks to my hardly good shows
And I wanna tell you suttin that you brolly don’t know
Dis that warthog millionaire collar bread flow nuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ma real friends take a hearing from me, fake friends turn a cold shoulder when they listen to me
But I don’t walk with you’s, I got heads in crews
I got my dick purple, from all these sexy boo’s
You gotta talk fast, if you want my love
But if you not talkin, you can catch a slug
See I been around, now I’m at the top
And all these sexy bitches, callin me hot and top
Caught a plane out, and fell asleep on it, so now I’m dreamin of bein fly
But I ain’t the nigga doping on the other guys

O-Rock

Just bought my niggas some cane, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumpin’ the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I’m forgiven for carin’ ’bout how they livin’
And loanin’ a little money and keepin’ ‘em out of prison
I ain’t lyin’ in my verses I’m just telling you the basics
Of growin’ up with your friends and becoming the one that made it, Yes lord!
All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talkin’ bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worry ’bout your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin’ like our collars up
And good ain’t good enough, and your hood ain’t hood enough
Spend my whole life putting on, you spend your whole life putting up
Ain’t no telling when I go, so there ain’t shit that I’mma wait for
I’m the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed forWith today being the 5th anniversary ofSo Far GoneI figured it's fitting to return to it's place of its origin in order toclear the air about an extremely emotional day. I completelysupport and agree with Rolling Stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary Phillip Seymour Hoffman.He is one of the most incredible actors of our timeand a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication.My frustration stemmed from the way it was executed.The circumstances at hand are completely justifiable (on the magazines behalf), but I was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating. They ran the issue without giving me a choice to be in it or not. I would have waited until it was my time because I understand the magnitude of the cover they chose but I just wasn't given that option and that made me feel violated. I apologize to anybody who took my initial comments out of context because in no way would I ever want to offend the Hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment. I am still the same person.Today I was forced out of my character and felt the need to react swiftly. These days are the worst ones.Waking up after a great night in the studio and it's your day to be picked apart. After dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time. So here I am having that moment.I once again apologize to everybody who took my cover comments the wrong way. I respect Rolling Stone for being willing to give a kid from Toronto a shot at the cover.I guess this is a day to learn and grow.

Sincerely,

The BoyHad hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys, forever-hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn


What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga


Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a Walkie-Talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge" song
"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just because" song
Damn

In the hood you earn your stripes, like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me, I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy


J's they callin' my phone, they tyin' my line
Labels, they callin' my phone, I don't wanna sign
They sayin' we made our own million dollars
At the top right now I wanna order up a million bottles
We came from juug in the Impala to smashin' them models
We independent, we don't need none of your major dollars


Flippin' and whippin' and spinnin' the dope,I'm hittin' the door
I wrap it in package, I'm shippin' the dope, run off with the the dope, I'm killin' that ho!
I'm takin' a trip to the Bahamas, going to pick up them comma's
And when I touchdown I'll hop in a Zonda
Smokin' on good marijuana in Mexico, call that quintana
Tryna fuck me a Rihanna
Comin' up, just me and Benji
Get rich or die try' like I'm 50
No cupid them bitches be kissin'
The feds they listen, them bricks in the kitchen!

[Hook: Quavo]x2


Sellin' a Grammy like Tony (Montana!), now I want Grammy's and ceremonies
These niggas snakin', always actin' funny,got the MAC-11, call it macaroni
Always gettin' trophies and recreation,Q.C. the label, the solid foundation
Sittin' at home I was contemplating, changing and switch up my situation
Tryna see the bigger picture,pull up to the award show in my new Fisker
No it ain't no money issue, grant all my momma's wishes
Watchin' her son on the channel,I won me a Grammy
And mansion I want me a Phantom
My nigga we next up, these niggas, they copy the swag, but no they not better than us

[Hook: Quavo]x2Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here?
Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other
Whoop! Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it


Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it


Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude, what's his name? Not important
I bought some cocaine, you can snort it
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly; Drake, Tunechi and Barbie
You knowAll I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cupsand I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one


You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't trust these bitches,they might catch me slipping
So, you're the only onecause I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one


Yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
Let's call up on drank and let's all get wasted
On drank and let's all get faded


Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the mothafuckin' North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make them like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, a.m. to the p.m
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him


That's that shit that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm 'em
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you


All I care about is money and the city that I’m from
I’mma sip until I feel it, I’mma smoke it 'til it’s done


All she cares about is money
And the city where she's from
Her intention is the paper
She don't need no fucking love


And I don’t really give a fuck and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told you


All I care about is money and the city that I’m from
I’mma sip until I feel it, I’mma smoke it 'til it’s done
And I don’t really give a fuck and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told you
I’m on one, fuck it, I’m on one
I said I’m on one, fuck it, I’m on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, I said fuck it I’m on one


All she cares about is money
And the city where she's from
Her intention is the paper
She don't need no fucking love
She spilling all this liquor
Trying to pass me all these cups
Well baby girl, I'm zoning
Somebody should've told her
I popped one
Fuck it, I popped one
Oh girl, I'm on one
I popped one


Girl, I'm lying, I'm on a few
Don't you worry, this ain't new
Can we take this to your spot?
I'm on eviction number 2
Cause I popped one


Fuck it I popped one

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfucking North Side

Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
One drink and let's all get faded, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Call up one drink and let's, let's call up one, uhSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get tosnapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
It's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected,people just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perksand
Niggas wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town

Chorus: (x4)
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try


And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range, Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money onbeats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..

Chorus: (x4)I just wanna shoot a movie with a chick from out the movies
With a big old ghetto booty that know how to roll a doobie
I just wanna hit the club, throw some money on the stage
I just wanna tip a stripper more dough than she ever made
More dough than she ever seen, now she see me in her dreams
All that ass, shawty bust it, how she stuff it in her jeans
Must run in her genes, I just wanna meet her momma
I just wanna smoke my presidential Juicy J Obama
Juicy J that OG, I been ballin' this whole week
Stuntin' 20 years plus, I can do this in my sleep
I just wanna fall in Onyx with a fine Georgia peach
Got that rocket in my pocket, that's that beauty and the beast


Legendary, love you so much it's unnecessary
Like it's always two weeks into February
You can take that shit to the cemetery, til we're dead and buried
But girl God forbid I feel too alive
Around you I got too much pride
Do we let it breathe or put a title on it?
I'm so indecisive, I'll let you decide
She like nah seem like your chakra's off
I'm like nah it's just that your top is off
And I started out wantin' to talk to you
And now all I can think about is poppin' off
Girl you're all that matters
You in bra and panties, that's automatic
You straddled me, I started fallin' backwards
Don't worry about the phone you can call them after
Bout to take ya down


Got the club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey


Squad goin' up, nobody flippin' packs now
I just did 3 in a row, them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound, you know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time to party on the weekend
Tell Gelo, "Bring the juice, we about to get lit"
Fill the room up with some tings, one night off and this is it
Always workin' OT, overtime and outta town
Shit is crazy back home, it kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep; shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle, I don't take them shits
But you do, so I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills, I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think how we had the club going up


Got the club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey


Workin' Monday night, on the corner flippin' hard
Made at least 3 thousand, on the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time to party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house, makin' juugs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state, makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance, you know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn 'bout what she think


Got the club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey


Got the club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she chooseyShe off a xanny and they bought to play that Boosie
I told her fuck it up, here go a shot of D'usse
Now go and back that ass upto this Juve
And let a nigga hit
(He ain't gotta know you going home with me)
I told that girl to, strip
You can hit the weed(But don't fall asleep on me)
You about to get this dick
It's too late to try to back down (back down)
She said tell Drizzy this my shit (shit)
I'ma tell him later, lay your ass down (remember)
Cause them legs going up..




Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga,rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup


Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials,you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real


How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Poraand listen to Cappadonna
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me,now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?


If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of usI never commented on Yeezus for my interview portion of Rolling Stone.They also took my cover from me last minute and ran the issue


I'm disgusted with that. RIP to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. All respect due. But the press is evil

I'm done doing interviews for magazines.I just want to give my music to the people.That's the only way my message gets across accuratelyDrake:The first million is the hardest.

T. Boone Pickens:The first billion is a helluva lot harder RT @Drake: The first million is the hardest.

Drake:@boonepickensjust stunted on me heavy.I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog


Just copped new shoes
Whip on two two's
Dick down you two
Throw it on YouTube
Tell me what you'd do
If I was to do you
Baby after one time
Sure to make you come back
Back like spinal, stack like dominoes
Catch me out in Mexico
Hasta mañana though, hasta la vista
Chest full of reefer
Rep for my set till the day I meet the Reaper
Petersburg veteran
USA resident
In USA Today it ain't a city I ain't never been
Scared I ain't never been
Yea I ain't never been
Nothing but a underdog
But I'm never under ya'll
Still keep it under there
Right by the underwear
Still in the hood yeah
I ain't talking outerwear
They be moving powder there
Which one of you out of there
Wanna get it
Cause I'm with it
Fuck ya'll, the underdog




Said I got my city buzzin
You should take a trip and view it
Shout out to Mr.Rogers
Cuz he's supposed to chop and screw it
And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
Cuz I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it ain't a Buick
I never rendezvous it
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga
And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the fuck you wanna do it
My nigga you better do it(Aye)...do it
I would say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I fuck with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drop it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia and coppertone
And girl I heard your man a fed, don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Ain't one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city, got 'em open like the lock is gone
Keys out, I ain't talking white though
Baby what you be's bout
I mean for tonight ho
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out
So I can J Holiday that ass
Before I leave's out
Holla at me shawty

Bridge over troubled water,ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see straight, I can't even see it straight
Uh, fuck with me,I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot but I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing "walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways


People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave,I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city(UGK, fuck these other niggas)


Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I don’t do nothing, I'mma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah, I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

I wouldn't be me if I didn't get a little nasty..
Na na na na na na na
They say all I ever talk about is sex...


How about we just pull over and do it where we at?
How about you just lift that skirt up..
Oo, We could be bad
That place that ain't been touched I'm in it
I’ll let you sit through, keep spinning on it
Girl - giddy up! Giddy up!
Take me on a ride to ecstasy
You don't wanna bump, bump, then take a nap
You just wanna bump, bump, get it right back
I'mma get it up, get it up


I know you're tired of the usual, the usual
I could give you more than the usual, the usual
When we touch, you gonna feel something unusual..
Tell you what, let me touch, you gonna feel something
Unusual..


I wanna do the freaky things you never do
What if we get it while your friends was in the room
Is that too hot for ya ?
Don’t you feel bad, Let em see your sexy ass
We can make a sex room wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, they ain’t gotta know
No . . Ohh
Watch me heat it up, Beat it up
Woo .. Hey!
Do You hear me girl ?
Watch me heat it up, Beat it up
Woo




This that other shit - I know you asked for it
I might just send you some money, get your passport
So you can come to my city
I take you all over, and hit you on the balcony
Please don't fall over!
Send me your pictures, baby, you know I'd never leak it
I know you got something recent for someone decent
Why you laughing out loud? I'm serious!
Bring your girl if you a little bi-curious
Please, please no storytelling to others
I know you gonna love it
I would never let you down
Might feel like I perfected all the things you expected
You gonna know it when you bring your ass around
Motherfu- Oh!




Do it all kinds of ways, in different places
Look at the many love faces you're making
Can you take it?

"..Y'all thought I was nasty last time...Leggo"This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I haven’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So I’m single,thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me, eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy,always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same


I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest nigga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me
(I'm doing my thing) I'm tryna be unforgettable


This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say "for life" y'all say "forever"
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon' get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’ma need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talkin' his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Same shit in them streets, so what's the dilly?
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life: no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life her name's the game




Got this top dropped on this beautiful night
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sara Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you bad enough that you don't even really need it
You could show at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your possie partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your virgin island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoevers money they spendin'
Screamin'


I Got To Be Unstoppable
I Got To Be Unstoppable
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
I Got To Be Unstoppable
I Got To Be Unstoppable
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie


My name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard workin'
Bizarre circus, that's when my bar's surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I layin' on my back I'm never backin' down
So over stand me,I got a condo in Miami
And my door mat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandanna
And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'
And I'm swingin' for the fence,your girl hangin' from my dick
Your girl singin' to my shit like A la-la-lollipop
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I pick that pussy better, better than her gynecologist
Ho just, text me whenever you want some more dick, more dick
Old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damnnnnn, all I got is one dick


I Got To Be Unstoppable
I Got To Be Unstoppable
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
I Got To Be Unstoppable
I Got To Be Unstoppable
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie

If you ask me I’m ready…

[Drake]
Ugh, Tez keeps telling me he just turned 30
Having dreams of being singleforeverhe’s getting worried
And I’m scared too becauseI’m in the same boat
Good women are rare too, none of them have come close
Me I haven't changed much, you know how I play
Better safe than sorry
Instead of searching for substance at every single party
Baby being part of this life
I feel like I’m bound to end up with somebody
That’s been with everybody
I need you to rescue me from my destiny
I’m trying to live right and give you whatever’s left of me
Cause you know life is what we make it and a
Chance is like a picture, it’d be nice if you just take it
Or let me take it for ya
I’m just down to ride
Or we can roll around the city until we finally decide
I got more than a thing for you, tattoo and ink for you
Right over my heart girl I do the unthinkable


You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
(Drake: I deserve it, I think it deserve it..Let it go)
It’s becoming something that’s impossible to ignore
And I can’t take it
(Drake: I can’t take it)


I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I’m ready
(Echo: I’m ready, I’m ready)
If you ask me I’m ready
(Echo: I’m ready, I’m ready)


I know you once said to me
“This is exactly how it should feel when it’s meant to be”
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually?
If we gon’ do something ’bout it
We should do it right now
(Drake: We should do it right now)

Bay, uh






Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away
I can’t say I came prepared
I’m suspended in the air
Won’t you come be in the sky with me


Now I wouldn't be me if I ain't get a little nasty
Na na-na na na na na na [x3]
They say all I talk about is sex...


How 'bout we just move over and do it where we at
How 'bout you just lift that skirt up ooh
We can be bad
That place that ain’t been touched, I’m feeling on it
I'll let you sit through, keep spinning on it
Girl! Giddy up, get it up
Take me on a ride to ecstasy
You don’t wanna bump bump then take a nap
You just wanna bump bump bring right back
Watch me
I'ma heat it up, beat it up
Oooh


Know you’re tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not coming with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual


I wanna do the freaky things you never do
What if we get it while your friends was in the room
Is that too hot for ya?
Don't you feel bad, Let em feel sexy
We can make a sex room wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, they ain’t gotta know no (no)
Watch me heat it up, beat it up
Woo. Hey! Do You hear me girl?
Watch me heat it up, beat it up, wooh



This that other shit, you know you ask for it
I might just send you some money, getcha passport
So you can come to me city, I’ll take you all over
And hit you on the balcony, just don’t fall over
Send me a picture baby, you know I’d never leak it
I know you got something recent, for someone decent
Why you laughing out loud, I’m serious
Bring your girl if you a little bi-curious
Please. Please no storytelling to others
I promise you gon' love it, I would never let you down
Feel like I might of perfected, All the things that you’ve expected
And you gon' know it when you bring your ass around
Motherfu... Oh!




Get it all different kind of ways
All different places
Look at the manyKush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying "you should quit", cars saying "fuck your life"
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does


I'm about whatever man,fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Man I love my team, man I love my team
I would die for them niggas


Drizzy say get her, I'mma get her
I got the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda.. wait-wait fixate
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake,bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase,never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the peach state
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that: sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha)
Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like "yes" and you like "no"
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed
I'm on a diet but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me




I'am watchful to the colors in this gloomy sky
The days have past away so Time needs to die
When I'm with you it go fast but away its too slow
Thinking about each other but Destiny's in the boat
This the Game now I been framed wow
Only to be with you I believe in you
Your the key to unlocking me to do anything, Your the reason why I would sing
And bring joy to this wonderful day, the music had prayed to steal my wonderful Life away
The melody has token too much of an up-ride so let me endorse my
Wonderful skill then tell me later how you feel, This not about the rapper
Or the Trouble he in, Or all the lieing that he's done Forgiving was they sin
Nah
(Hook+Bridge: Drake)Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her


Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, "Drake is just a younger you"
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin Wayne Brady
Damn, Whose Line is it Anyway?
I'm in the daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been a blaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to ya life




Bun B, king of the trill,also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mayne, this gon' be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?




I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagga supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo bitch, I do this shit,I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And mutha-fucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'mma start shootin in a moshpit

If I don’t know your momma, I'mma make him feel it
Heavy Armor-All, you know I wanna shine
Bitch, I need it all, each and every dime
Photos taken, four-door Maybach, I know you hating
Staying with women from Staten Island, my flows so flagrant

Higher than yours,Cash Money, I see no limits
Port of Miami, then I drop Trilla
Ex-dope dealer worth eight figures




Just got back from Turks and Caicos, hoes all at the villa
Only nigga making albums with no fucking filla
New deal on the table, look like 'bout like ten milla

Them other boys well known for letting niggas starve
We eating good, not my fault, it's Wingstop's
My new home look like it's Al Capone
My new bitch look like she in them folds
My new watch look like I had it stole
Barry Weiss told me I'm gold, God forgives, I don't
Me and Drizzy like The Beatles, nigga
Same ones hating, wouldn't wanna be them niggas
We let 'em stare, but we don't see them niggas
We don't see them niggas

Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker
Boys playin' Playstation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?


Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it


I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man


Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy




When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch



Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interviewMan that shit you talking raising my sodium
When I step to the podium
Like they bringing the trophy in
They like "Aww, there he go again"
I do what I got to do to ride up in that European
I knew back when I was playing Little League down at Bobian
That, that boy had that glow like he ran off with plutonium
Back when I had a crush on every girl on Nickelodeon
Man I knew I had to be in and out of Fallopian
Bank accounts at Wachovia
I can't be no custodian
Just imagine how the drama felt
Imagine how my momma felt
Swimming in the debt boy I was hungrier than ever
Ya this must be how piranhas felt
I had to put my G-Shock back on just to go remind myself
When we needed all kind of help
Back when we was all alone on our own
Now they on my phoneSean Don Corleone
Fuck every OG who passed up on my and put me on a song
Except for Ye so I'm forever repping foot up on the throne
You was popping back when I was wearing pow chains
Now you back at home, how mane?
Whole squad come together killing shit like the Power Rangers
I stay in tune and out of danger
Lady on the way Mercedes on the way
Album on the way
Rapping like I got a baby on the way
I'm like Baby with the pay
Pay me when? Today
Bitch it’s do or die, seven days a week and holidays
Ho ass bitch

Look at the watch, blow it, hot like some Taki
Come in my room, my sheet Versace
Go to sleep, I dream Versace
Medusa, Medusa, Medusa
These niggas they wishin' they knew you
They coppin' the Truey, remixing the Louis
My blunts is fat as Rasputia
In a striped shirt like I’m Tony the Tiger
I’m beating the pot, call me Michael
Lot of you niggas that copy
Look at my closet Versace, Versace




King of Versace, Medusa my wifey
My car is Versace, I got stripes on my Mazi
I'm dressin' so nicely they can't even copy
You'd think I'm Egyptian, this gold on my body
Money my mission, two bitches, they kissin'
My diamonds is pissing, my swag is exquisite
Young Offset no preacher but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons
Codeine sippin, Versace I’m gripping them bands in my pocket
You know that I’m living
I’m draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs, that’s Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I think I’m the don, but no Rocco
This the life that I chose
Bought out the store, can’t go back no more
Versace my clothes while I’m selling them bows
Versace take over it took out my soul

Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be witouth my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
Chillin on the linen,she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so I'm winnin every race that I enter and she a


Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a...
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same

And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself


My old girl would say
Look at Vida Guerrera
There's no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet she's out meetin' directors instead
And frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl there's things to do
Other than jail time
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it
I got some beats still
Regina hall and garcelle and alice neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not
My cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill


Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself


And I ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
You must remember wakin' up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin' me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?
Now we back in California, we don't even speak
That's a no no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do, that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you, with Jen and Melissa
(Say Hi, M)
Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin' out, swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I, was tryna' make a, MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin' how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me, for everything I did
It's some views from the 6
Just some views from the 6

Genius knows that there is a version of this song floating around with a verse from another person on it. However, there have been many sources claiming that the incomplete track was stolen, recorded over, and then leaked by the artist on the second verse. We at Genius do not condone this activity and will not have his verse for viewing on our site until we have a confirmation that it is legitimate

Thank youI know there’s other people that you talk to
But I just hate getting any proof shown to me (shown to me)
I know there’s other places that you could go
But I'd just really love it if you made it home to me (home to me)
Yeah, young girl, you love life
Same birthday as Pac, thug life
Gemini, I understand why ya uptight
Cause once you give away the pussy, then you’re fucked right?
Yeah, I wonder if I should call you
But then again you never call me
And I’m just looking at my phone girl
And the last 3 messages are all me
Damn, that’s doing a lot
I mean I’ve always been the type to know when to stop
For real, I mean I want you in the worst way
And I know one day doesn’t mean the first day
Yeah and it ain’t morning but it’s late enough
And I just showered I just shaved, I just straightened up
And I’m tired of the games, we done played enough
I hope you’re still coming cause I’m waiting up


All the missed calls got me thinking
Maybe I’m trippin’
But I want you to feel the other side (other side)
Now I’m waiting up (got you waiting)
Now I’m waiting up (ooh, got you waiting)
Now I’m waiting up
Now I’m waiting up, waiting up, up, up…


Voicemail when I call ya phone
I know just how you feel
I know just how you feel, how you feel
Baby when you home alone
I know just how you feel (do you know?)
I know just how you feel
Girl now I’m waiting up


Now the shoe is on the other foot
I’m here with my daughter she keeps staring like her mother look
And the hours keeps passing and I'm thinking about spazzing
Couldn’t even imagine, her catching up with her passed friend
Saying how was and he asking, a has-been
Has been shady, then she telling her she hate me
And she been would’ve left if it wasn’t for the baby
Iknow it sound crazy, that wasn’t the plan
You see I’m just a young boy, that’s raising a man
Listen look I’m really sorry for raising my hand
All the false allegations, I’m taking a stand
Damn, damn, how did we get here?
Girl, its feeling like the end isn’t near
You say you don’t care
I just hope its out of anger
Good girl gone bad, I can’t blame ya
Signs read danger (I open my eyes)
Girl, you saying that you pregnant, I’m hoping it’s lies
While they all sound true, it’s sad girl, the things that I do
They all affect you
Like they don’t affect me
Girl, I’m mad cause the things you can’t see
It’s what it’s gon’ be
I’m making a change
The best thing we ever had, we take it in vain

How come when the media stops covering and there’s a little help from the government
We forget about the people still strugglingand assume that its really all love again, nah
See we don’t have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren't involved before, it’s never too late to start
You probably think that it’s too far to even have to care
Well take a look at where you live what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again

[Chorus x2]


Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause I'm lonely


Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae


But name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely


This shit ain’t my faultOkay, you know you been on my mind, A-Town, I miss you
When ol' girl would come late and bring all her tips through
Break up her weed while I break down my issues
Get paper, she blows that, the next day, you know that
Daydream at night time I think too much
Then I hit the nightclub till its daytime and I drink too much
Not time for no good girl, they hold on and they cling too much
I just want a hood bitch that tell me that I sing too much
Ooh yeah, shout out to the women playing y'all position
I be moving through my city like a politician
Hope you don't judge me cuz me and you are not all that different
You made me this way, you made me famous, you all assisted
New niggas tryna shine I didn't condone it
But I'm back in this bitch, re-living the moment
I'm about to have it poppin off again
Drama bout to make it rain on Mary Poppins and her friends
We got..


Wein our pocket, and whatever you're sipping on
Red-bottom limping around this bitch, what the fuck you tripping on?
Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone
And they gon put you back in place if you do something wrong
We in this bitch, yeah we in this bitch, yeah
We got a section full of girls and they barely speak any English
Let's toast it up toand I mean it


Water water all around me, damn my diamonds are shinin
Money rainin on you bitches, Future changin the climate
All I hang around is millionaires and a bunch of cons
Turn up, turn up, turn up it's like a burnt a bunch of Suns
Hah, from Milwaukee to Atlanta
They put myon camera, they tripping, no cockin hammers
Addicted to, I like em when they bougie
Anytime I step out, when I come through, it's a zoovie
Ain't rapping to ya, I'm really trapping with words
And I ain't braggin' to ya when I say I'm fly as a bird
That girl don't speak no Englo but she know all my lingo
She know a Rarri when she see one and she know a c-note
I got a Haitian girl speak Creoleand a spanish girl from Rio
We could put them in a room together make a perfect combo
They bout that life, I'm bout that life, yes we is, yes we is
The money, bitches and cars come with the life that I live
It should've been a designer party, all these designer round me
Pick a name, anything, money can buy what?Diamond chain
Diamond ring,Murcielagos,Balenciagas
We toasted up to the life, niggas it's ours

Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential -- do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street, got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib, goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here
The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then


I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no (say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine


Used to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man
You keep talking that, "You was this and you had this"
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, "you're such a dog", I said, "you're such a bone."
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, "show me some"
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then


I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no (say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine


I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine


I'm fine we're fine but yes of course we murder time
This beat's a corpse in the back of the room that's mine
Mess with you because you're dumb and we're just having fun
Dreams of making millions that's paper to the cieling
And i ain't saying we the shit but if you gotta
Then let them know to hit the road we taking over shows
And like a penalty i got red flags
In the sky in disguise my boys ride
I would look outside if you feel somebody's watching
Tick tock im knocking clocks in man screw a clock in
This the team and you could say we do it often
Zay Drizzy and Jerz we get it poppin


You can call me superman with an S upon my chest
Never give rappers chances because I'm always at my best
I keep the comp worried like game set and match
And they wonder how they get out like where's the escape hatch
Drake already said that we'll be fine
No more take out for us we wine and dine
Never dull moments when living express line
Now watch us do our thing no need for stars aligned


I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine


We'll be fine got my fam and my homies
What's the time gotta make sure my girl ain't lonely
Oh but i gotta remind dont forget that we the only
Greatest ones in this last year in this cuz
We be getting rich can't even make a wish
Man i swear it's like we run these kids we be throwing back our lids
What we say is what we do even if it is
Something that's too cold for you because we dont care if you freeze in this


I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine[Hook:]

Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it, aye
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it


She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007 I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!"
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
Imma just hand her a business card and say "Nigga we made it!"
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"

[Interlude:]
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show

If I said it, I meant it, it's no way around it
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up watch Gway go crazy
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like "Nigga we made it!"
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in yo' face and say "Nigga we made it!"
I swear that we made it, sell out that ting, I'm the king in Jamaica
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell yah, I don't need no favors
(Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters)
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it?Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like "Nigga we made it!"

Should've been part of the opera the way that I play in the Phantom
This bird on my seat kind of bright for me, fuck it I told them to tan em'
First rapping nigga that powered the streets so the radio banned him
I'm looking for something to surf on the night with a body so vicious
If she not fucking I tell her get lost and I send her the worst of my wishes
I'm helping my niggas get dinner we eating, they talking bout dishes
Fuck with my money I'm pricing your head, blow the rest on these bitches
Nigga we made it x2
Try to keep that on the low, cause them people find out we gon' probably get raided
Find me a tutor, head game was smart to the point I was searching for knowledge
She just got her masters, something amazing you would think she fresh out of college
Shout out to Drizzy and OVO, and this shit I just got from Tokyo
That alley hoop helped me, I'm finna' score
Gotta let my nuts hang on before we go
I'm patiently waiting, swang is patiently skating
Just incase they ain't hear what I stated, I ain't worried

In 2007 I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!"
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
I'm a just hand her a business card and say, "Nigga we made it!"
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"Ugh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about are talkin' blunt and stayin' blunted
Pretty women are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all just disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You seem to flee to all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rolling and their mood change
Like a muthafucka
New flow, I got a dozen of em
I don't trust you, you're an undercover
I could probably make some stepsisters fuck each other, whew
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What? Tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

[Hook: Mally Mall] x2
Whatcha say huh?
Whatcha say huh?
Whatcha say huh?
Real niggas all day, all day what


Whew, this the king from under
They say to bet against the odds but I like even numbers
The kid, I'm all up at the cribbo, fuckin' on a bad bitch
Ass like a hippo, leavin' bitches crippled
Read the bitch MO, play it like a demo
Trickin' when ya got it really is a n-o
But I'm just really stickin' how I feel right now huh
Niggas can't stand real right now, huh?
Can't see me, invisible
Make ya bitch need the kid, feinin' like it's critical
Rappers try to see me, feelin' so invisible
Niggas wanna be me, bout to get it physical, ain't stoppin'
Clock stop it, pop lock it
Stock option, cock block it, Glock cock it
To take a shot, girl your genitals
Got me goin' in with only 60 minute intervals
You know you bad




Oh, it's the 8th wonder
Wonder how I keep comin' with the Bay number
Yeah, I play the money, I play it off cause you ain't had a lot
She gon' say I'm cocky, told her "You know that I get that a lot"
Codeine, like a night game
The rave cocaine came with a scale mane
Trynna be the only one, that's a long race
I'll call you Billie Jean, but what would Mike say?
In L.A, in L.A, in L.A (in L.A)
We in the mansion, all day
MIA, all the girls with it
Late night, they say "Don't stop, get it, get it"
8 mil' for the new home
See the gold car, she like Raw home
No shades I'll bring it to ya face nigga
Like whatcha say, whatcha say, nigga

What if I kissed you right now
How would we explain it
Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out
What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off our shoulders
Take me I'm yours
And I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions
If we were a secret how long could you keep it
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
*mumbles* away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine

What if I kissed you right now...

Would it bring us any closer
Take a weight off of our shoulders
Tell on me
I dont mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie...

...admit that I'm yours
Idon't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions

If we were a secret
Tell me could u keep it?
Keep it your yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
*mumbles* away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine

What if I kissed you right now
What if I kissed you right now

Just be mine (just be mine)
And u just be mine.. all mine
And u just be mine (just, just be mine)
And u just be mine.. all mineI'm on that old, switch lanes shit, Jay, Big, Dame's shit
Talking 'bout them niggas that my daddy pitch cane wit
Because I never learned the biz, I learned the language
Well-spoken, man I should've went to Cambridge
And mama would always claim this
I never expected the outcome, but one day I became this
Famous, no longer nameless
More game, but I'm the same, I will remain this
I'm still focused, I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read "48 Laws" if you never read it
Because that is one of the main reasons I'm level-headed
Despite the accumulated success
If my attitude ever strayed, I made it regress
I never wanted to win the lottery only because my uncle
Told me "He who made it by struggling made it the best"
So with that on my chest, I'm down on my last 12 gs
Going through the closet thinking I should prolly sell these
Chanel Cs,and LVs, somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all, who needs anymore?
Whose satisfied doin' good deeds anymore?
Who grieves anymore, who believes anymore?
Who graduated school and still reads anymore?
Not me, that should have my whole race shook
Because we don't read novels but we do FaceBook
The new craze is havin' that new age look
If I said I liked it, I'd feel like a two-faced crook
Nah, I tell retro kids tie that bandana just a little bit tighter
'Til it suffocates you, biter
Cause I don't wear no bright colors or rope chains
I'm a G, my daddy was in the dope gameI heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah, you know word of mouth
The square root of 69 is 8 something, right?
Cause I've been tryna work it out
Uh, good weed, white wine
I come alive in the night time
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Let it play, say you gotta leave
But I know you wanna stay
You just waiting on the traffic jam to finish girl
The things we could do in twenty minutes girl
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go the text that I write is gonna say




Baby you got me
And ain't nowhere that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth you rock me
So I surrender to every word you whisper
Every door you enter, I will let you in




You're so amazing, you took the time to figure me out
That's why you take me, way past the point of turning me on
You 'bout to break me, I swear you got me losing my mindDrinks Houston, what's up?Onyx, what's up?

Kush is dead Im getting blowed
Riding bangin getting throwed in the candy painted low
Chrome grill in front of it
Belts on the back of it, my homie shoes running it
And shorty on the side of me is straight up off the king cover
Don’t care what anybody say long as the King love her
Wish I could tell her that I dont but it would kill her
I just keep on gripping grains dripping stains
Being trilla ain't another brother realer
Blowing thousand dollar killer
With the Filipino flow that I just got it from Manila
Bout to snow up in my city
So let me put on my chincilla
And I got verses, I got verses
My 16s should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah heartbreak Drake I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
And tryna' make all my goals for the future come overnight
God-god-god-god damn how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over watch a season of Flight of the Concords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But uh, tell me you surfin' let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured
Yes I swear to God girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Ford's
Ethiopian girl Ethiopian girl
With yo' long curly hair and yo' big ass bootay
Reading all them pro black pro female books
Just let 'em let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription a vision correction
I'm young and successful, I'm living perfection
And mayne if '09 is when I'mma see mine
Being cool ain't enough homie I'mma freeze time
Like that
(*Beat slows*)I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I can’t believe we’re finished
My life is movin’ fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I can’t put this behind me
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could’ve had my all by now, by now
It’s been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question


I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you


I swear I heard you call
But when I heard you'd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
I'm steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keep looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could have all my love right now, by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
That's why I'm asking this question...




I can't go to bed
I'm thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a U-Haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?
We were on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out

Took if from signing my own yearbook to booked for the year
Got a condo and I couldn’t even cook for you here
Took it from bs checks to TSX
To people wondering if its the Phantom he gets next
Who knows, its the rabbit its buzzing for real here
The rapper everybody got a cousin he’s feeling
Its kinda ironic you fit with them
Cause they wasn’t really around when it wasn’t appealing
Now its denim diamonds an perfume spraying
Four star rooms are the worst you stay in
(I love the line about the range with the rims to match)
What girl that wasn’t me who’s verse you saying
Shit I would never tell you nothing like that
Them other niggas you spend on, cuff em like that
See the difference with me I don’t forget the past
And you gave me nothing so I’m gonna give you nothing right back, like…


Young, dumb, looking in the mirror
Trying to figure out who Im gonna be this year
Its funny you managed to be around for the present
All puns intended your funds are mended
If I take back the cheddar it'll better for both us
No debts owed we can both let go
Before this I could never get a call from ya
Now all texts finish XOXO
But this ain't hollywood squares to me
Sweetie I’m far from a hollywood charity
And I bet when you talking to your friends
You messing with other dudes that you probably compare to me
But if its not Drake and one of us wrong you forget my birthday and know none of my songs
You coulda told me before your heart wasn’t in it, fine
But try to get a start at the finish line
Ah

Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? Came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had to rent that on the dick ass jocking
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the gram now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the stove?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco


12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors gotta young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O ho, we call that ho an onion


Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was what's the hold up?
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we’re paying back dues
Where were you? When all the dogs needed help
Lawyers and the commissary ain’t gon’ pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain’t got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I’m self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I’ll buy the neighbors house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, last winter was the coldest?
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders


60 for a walk, bitch don’t panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food; call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I’m here today cause I ain't never gave up
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
Where you ass was at, when I was trapping at the stove?
Had to struggle to get where I was at and sell dope


I'm that nigga with the plugs
I'm the nigga who got homies that be sellin' drugs
I'm the nigga on the back street
With the fat heat, niggas better run like athletes
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
My Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block
Police pull up, I'm tryna stash the Glock
You that nigga on the low-low
You're the nigga, you're the one that be talkin' to the po-pos
Porsche sittin' on Forgi's
Niggas can't afford these
The Panamera shittin' on the 9-11
I call my homies, not 911
I'm the nigga with the juice
But I'll never do my nigga like Pac did Q


Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?


Champagne
I got a shorty name Texas Syn
She got a buddy named Young JB and now you know the deal
We turnt up in the studio late night
That's why the songs that you hear are comin' real tight
OVO crew, nigga, thought I told you
If you a player in the game, this should hold you
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did the motto, took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big
Young Money shit, me and Lil Wayne too big
I'mma crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big
Wassup

I could bet all the riches that I ever had
Rush in the night like a shock, babe, would it be bad?
If I had to-
Set the alarm cause those thrills that run up my back
You're my star nothing else can lead me off track


Hey-yeaahh....
You're like a wildfire
You got me rising hot
Your innocence-
Who's the brave?
Drowning in
Would you save me?
It's a crime-
If you don't
You'll expire
By the throat



Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'mma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick her flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold


I say damn I must be left
Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a proand you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner




Now she don't know about mebut I'mma put her on it
And she ain't sure up out me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair her could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

Worst...
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit...
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see if I'm finished


Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B




Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp,Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessins at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A.,open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior


(Uh,Yeah, alright, Uh well alright, yeah Well alright uh-huh, yeah "Feel good")

It's a celebration clap, clap BRAVO !
Lobster &amp; shrimp &amp; a Glass of Mescado

Girl your on fire, Can I be the one you match with ? i'll give you a credit card &amp; Baby you could max this OUT ! Show me were your tats is, show me were your hands at maybe I could grasp it.

Yeah &amp; I got it together, So when they talk &amp; try to Detour me it's like whatever. Tell 'em I appreciate the help. But I just got to know for myself



Would you love me, if I didn't sing any songs ? if I couldn't take you home ? Would you love me, if I couldn't buy you things ? shoes &amp; diamond rings ? Would you love me if I spent my life, with the same old 9 to 5 ? Would you love me, if I couldn't give it all to you ? Would you love me if I didn't say, Baby you look fly today ? Would you love me if we can't Break away, Take you on a Holiday (yeah) ? Would you love me, if I Said things I don't mean ? would you leave or Stay ? Would you lovee me ? I say maybe. If it goes wrong would you just leave me ? Now would you lovee me ? I say maybe, if it goes wrong, would you stay or would you go ? would you love me ?



This life style is vile, The shit will damage ya, Especially when you think No ones understandin' ya. these girls prove with their over protective Managers, Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin' their cameras. Snap, snap, snap til there running out of card space, you remind me of Tony's sister on Scareface just take it easy on love and slow your heart rate. Goodness gracious, the top is just a hard place. Yeeah but if you never even been there, it kinda make sense' why you diein' to pretend there. Spillin' all your drinks, takin' pictures in your swim-wear. Head up in the clouds, you surviing on thin air. (would you love me) I know that shit is exhaustin' girl, and your mistakes are Costin' girl, and maybe ll dont need the help but I just gotta see for myself...

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitationand you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobodyand that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure


How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?


Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man


I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitationand you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobodyand that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sureListen girl
You so bad and you single, what's this I hear?
We ain't met yet, my name Drake
AndI'mma take the world over,this my year
This I swear
Had my share of women that I been with
I'm young can ya blame me?
I know you feel like a lot of things off-limits
At least let me describe what it can be
Be faithful, I'll do that
Na, really baby girl, I'll do that
Cause everybody break up when they cake up
We could be the couple that'll never go through that
Yeah, and if we ever fallin' off
I swear I'll remind you that
We're not who they are,now all I really gotta do is find you
Where you at?


From the east to the west
Scream for me if you my number one lady
Take a lead from the rest
You can go fast speed it up for me baby
And the key, what's next
One night with me would drive you crazy
One night with me would drive you crazy

When it starts are you ready?
Take your marks and get steady
You know that it's about to get heavy
But she's a rider, a rider, my Yamaha Mama

Ay, ay, she my
My Yamaha Mama
Ay, ay, be my
My Yamaha Mama
Ay, ay, she my
My Yamaha Mama
Ay, ay, be my


Tell me how to locate you
I know satellites all break through
But they don't ever lead me straight to
And I gotta arrive fo' somebody take you
Know there's someone you don't mean a lot to
And he would hate to know that I got you
I even got a speech in my head
That I write and recite at the moment I spot you
"Hey there, your name is?
I like that, it's suits ya
I'm young, but different
I'm not what you're used to
At all"
If we stop at the same red light
I'mma celebrate the fact that I found you girl
And I'mma ride for you too, as soon as it turn green
Wanna hear from my ladies all around the world
Where you at?

You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in ’02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but im still playin' like im bein' scouted til im outted
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know



Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don’t get held up at the border
Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that ’62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin that that isn’t what the motive is
They ain't rooting for me, they ain't clapping for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

Having conversations with mama,man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who"
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who"
And she like, "who are we kidding?You're 27, you just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is a time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me ,momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life


Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness,and fuck it, look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down,I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my lifeAlright, well alright
I say I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A picture won't do me Justice League in this bitch
I’ma do me trust this
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this
I got the hammer money sweetie you can’t touch this
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario
Coming through ya stereo
Plus my girlfriend booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motha fucking Mario
Yeah, and Polow isn’t at my session
Mr Anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like


Look, my ex girl said she done dating black guys
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
Not me I make your battle ships capsize
Get soaked get wet get baptized
I got the full package a nigga complete
I get bread and eat tracks like lunch meat
Sue me and Ima put you on front street
Probably get your records pushed back like front seats
I’m much more then you fathom he would be
And ain't too many niggas that I’d rather be than me
I guarantee the women getting at him would agree
That he should go ahead and put a patent on his g
And I swear these niggas gassed up even though the price is high
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
You know my coupe sit super low
Top slipped off like Janet at the superbowl
